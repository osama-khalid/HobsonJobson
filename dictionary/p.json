{"paddy": "s. Rice in the husk; but the word is also, at least in composition, applied to growing rice. The word appears to have in some measure, a double origin.\n There is a word batty (see BATTA) used by some writers on the west coast of India, which has probably helped to propagate our uses of paddy. This seems to be the Canarese batta or bhatta, 'rice in the husk,' which is also found in Mahr. as bh\u0101t with the same sense, a word again which in Hind. is applied to 'cooked rice.' The last meaning is that of Skt. bhakt\u0101, which is perhaps the original of all these forms.\n But in Malay p\u0101d\u012b [according to Mr. Skeat, usually pronounced p\u0103di] Javan. p\u0101r\u012b, is 'rice in the straw.' And the direct parentage of the word in India is thus apparently due to the Archipelago; arising probably out of the old importance of the export trade of rice from Java (see Raffles, Java, i. 239-240, and Crawfurd's Hist. iii. 345, and Descript. Dict., 368). Crawfurd, (Journ. Ind. Arch., iv. 187) seems to think that the Malayo-Javanese word may have come from India with the Portuguese. But this is impossible, for as he himself has shown (Desc. Dict., u.s.), the word p\u0101r\u012b, more or less modified, exists in all the chief tongues of the Archipelago, and even in Madagascar, the connection of which last with the Malay regions certainly was long prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.\n 1580. -- \"Certaine Wordes of the naturall language of Jaua . . .

A priest, clergyman, or minister, of the Christian Religion; when applied by natives to their own priests, as it sometimes is when they speak to Europeans, this is only by way of accommodation, as 'church' is also sometimes so used by them.\n The word has been taken up from the Portuguese, and was of course applied originally to Roman Catholic priests only. But even in that respect there was a peculiarity in its Indian use among the Portuguese. For P. della Valle (see below) notices it as a singularity of their practice at Goa that they gave the title of Padre to secular priests, whereas in Italy this was reserved to the religiosi or regulars. In Portugal itself, as Bluteau's explanation shows, the use is, or was formerly, the same as in Italy; but, as the first ecclesiastics who went to India were monks, the name apparently became general among the Portuguese there for all priests.\n It is a curious example of the vitality of words that this one which had thus already in the 16th century in India a kind of abnormally wide application, has now in that country a still wider, embracing all Christian ministers. It is applied to the Protestant clergy at Madras early in the 18th century. A bishop is known as Lord (see LAT) padre. See LAT Sahib.\n According to Leland the word is used in China in the form pa-ti-li.\n 1541. -- \"Chegando \u00e1 Porta da Igreja, o sahira\u0303o a receber oito Padres.\" -- Pinto, ch. lxix.

In the following passage it seems to mean 'factory stock':\n [1615. -- \"The King says that at her arrival he will send them their house and pagarr upon rafts to them.\" -- Foster, Letters, iii. 151.]\n b. (pag\u0101r). This word is in general use in the Bombay domestic dialect for wages, Mahr. pag\u0101r. It is obviously the Port. verb pagar, 'to pay,' used as a substantive.\n [1875. -- \". . . the heavy-browed sultana of some Gangetic station, whose stern look palpably interrogates the amount of your monthly paggar.\" -- Wilson, Abode of Snow, 46.]\n", "pagoda": "s. This obscure and remarkable word is used in three different senses.\n a. An idol temple; and also specifically, in China, a particular form of religious edifice, of which the famous \"Porcelain tower\" of Nanking, now destroyed, may be recalled as typical. In the 17th century we find the word sometimes misapplied to places of Mahommedan worship, as by Faria-ySousa, who speaks of the \"Pagoda of Mecca.\"\n b. An idol.\n c. A coin long current in S. India. The coins so called were both gold and silver, but generally gold. The gold pagoda was the var\u0101ha or h\u016bn of the natives (see HOON); the former name (fr. Skt. for 'boar') being taken from the Boar avat\u0101r of Vishnu, which was figured on a variety of ancient coins of the South; and the latter signifying 'gold,' no doubt identical with son\u0101, and an instance of the exchange of h and s. (See also PARDAO.)\n Accounts at Madras down to 1818 were kept in pagodas, fanams, and k\u0101s (see CASH); 8 k\u0101s = 1 fanam, 42 fanams =1 pagoda. In the year named the rupee was made the standard coin.* The pagoda was then reckoned as equivalent to 3\u00bd rupees.\n In the suggestions of etymologies for this word, the first and most prominent meaning alone has almost always been regarded, and doubtless justly; for the other uses are deduceable from it. Such suggestions have been many.\n Thus Chinese origins have been propounded in more than one form; e.g. Pao-t'ah, 'precious pile,' and Pohkuh-t'ah ('white-bones-pile').\u2020 Anything can be made out of Chinese monosyllables in the way of etymology; though no doubt it is curious that the first at least of these phrases is actually applied by the Chinese to the polygonal towers which in China foreigners specially call pagodas. Whether it be possible that this phrase may have been in any measure formed in imitation of pagoda, so constantly in the mouth of foreigners, we cannot say (though it would not be a solitary example of such borrowing -- see NEELAM); but we can say with confidence that it is impossible pagoda should have been taken from the Chinese. The quotations from Corsali and Barbosa set that suggestion at rest.\n Another derivation is given (and adopted by so learned an etymologist as H. Wedgwood) from the Portuguese paga\u0303o, 'a pagan.' It is possible that this word may have helped to facilitate the Portuguese adoption of pagoda; it is not possible that it should have given rise to the word. A third theory makes pagoda a transposition of da Prinsep's Useful Tables, by E. Thomas, p. 19.\n Giles, Glossary of Reference, s.v.\n goba. The latter is a genuine word, used in Ceylon, but known in Continental India, since the extinction of Buddhism, only in the most rare and exceptional way.\n A fourth suggestion connects it with the Skt. bhagavat, 'holy, divine,' or Bhagavat\u012b, applied to Durg\u0101 and other goddesses; and a fifth makes it a corruption of the Pers. but-kadah, 'idol-temple'; a derivation given below by Ovington. There can be little doubt that the origin really lies between these two.\n The two contributors to this book are somewhat divided on this subject:-\n (1) Against the derivation from bhagavat, 'holy,' or the Mahr. form bhagavant, is the objection that the word pagode from the earliest date has the final e, which was necessarily pronounced. Nor is bhagavant a name for a temple in any language of India. On the other hand but-kadah is a phrase which the Portuguese would constantly hear from the Mahommedans with whom they chiefly had to deal on their first arrival in India. This is the view confidently asserted by Reinaud (M\u00e9moires sur l'Inde, 90), and is the etymology given by Littr\u00e9.\n As regards the coins, it has been supposed, naturally enough, that they were called pagoda, because of the figure of a temple which some of them bear; and which indeed was borne by the pagodas of the Madras Mint, as may be seen in Thomas's Prinsep, pl. xlv. But in fact coins with this impress were first struck at Ikkeri at a date after the word pagode was already in use among the Portuguese. However, nearly all bore on one side a rude representation of a Hindu deity (see e.g. K\u1e5bish\u1e47ar\u0101ja's pagoda, c. 1520), and sometimes two such images. Some of these figures are specified by Prinsep (Useful Tables, p. 41), and Varthema speaks of them: \"These pardai . . . have two devils stamped upon one side of them, and certain letters on the other\" (115-116). Here the name may have been appropriately taken from bhagavat (A. B.).\n On the other hand, it may be urged that the resemblance between butkadah and pagode is hardly close enough, and that the derivation from but-kadah does not easily account for all the uses of the word. Indeed, it seems admitted in the preceding para graph that bhagavat may have had to do with the origin of the word in one of its meanings.\n Now it is not possible that the word in all its applications may have had its origin from bhagavat, or some current modification of that word? We see from Marco Polo that such a term was currently known to foreign visitors of S. India in his day -- a term almost identical in sound with pagoda, and bearing in his statement a religious application, though not to a temple.* We thus have four separate applications of the word pacauta, or pagoda, picked up by foreigners on the shores of India from the 13th century downwards, viz. to a Hindu ejaculatory formula, to a place of Hindu worship, to a Hindu idol, to a Hindu coin with idols represented on it. Is it not possible that all are to be traced to bhagavat, 'sacred,' or to Bhagavat and Bhagavat\u012b, used as names of divinities -- of Buddha in Buddhist times or places, of K\u1e5bish\u1e47a and Durg\u0101 in Brahminical times and places? (uses which are fact). How common was the use of Bhagavat\u012b as the name of an object of worship in Malabar, may be seen from an example. Turning to Wilson's work on the Mackenzie MSS., we find in the list of local MS. tracts belonging to Malabar, the repeated occurrence of Bhagavati in this way. Thus in this section of the book we have at p. xcvi. (vol. ii.) note of an account \"of a temple of Bhagavati\"; at p. ciii. \"Temple of Mannadi Bhagavati goddess . . .\"; at p. civ. \"Temple of Mangombu Bhagavati . . .\"; \"Temple of Paddeparkave Bhagavati . . .\"; \"Temple of the goddess Pann\u00e1yennar Kave Bhagavati . . .\"; \"Temple of the goddess Pat\u00e1li Bhagavati . . .\"; \"Temple of Bhagavati . . .\"; p. cvii., \"Account of the goddess Bhagavati at, &c. . . .\"; p. cviii., \"Acc. of the goddess Yalanga Bhagavati,\" \"Acc. of \"The prayer that they say daily consists of these words: 'Pacauta! Pacauta! Pacauta!' And this they repeat 104 times.\" -- (Bk. iii. ch. 17.) The word is printed in Ramusio pacauca; but no one familiar with the constant confusion of c and t in medieval manuscript will reject this correction of M. Pauthier. Bishop Caldwell observes that the word was probably Bagav\u0101, or Pagav\u0101, the Tamil form of Bhagavata, \"Lord\"; a word reiterated in their sacred formulae by Hindus of all sorts, especially Vaishnava devotees. The words given by Marco Polo, if written \"Pagoda! Pagoda! Pagoda!\" would be almost undistinguishable in sound from Pacauta.\n the goddess Vallur Bhagavati.\" The term Bhagavati seems thus to have been very commonly attached to objects of worship in Malabar temples (see also Fra Paolino, p. 79 and p. 57, quoted under c. below). And it is very interesting to observe that, in a paper on \"Coorg Superstitions,\" Mr. Kittel notices parenthetically that Bhadr\u0101 K\u0101l\u012b (i.e. Durg\u0101) is \"also called Pogo\u0306di, Pavodi, a tadbhava of Bagavati\" (Ind. Antiq. ii. 170) -- an incidental remark that seems to bring us very near the possible origin of pagode. It is most probable that some form like pogodi or pagode was current in the mouths of foreign visitors before the arrival of the Portuguese; but if the word was of Portuguese origin there may easily have been some confusion in their ears between Bagavati and but-kadah which shaped the new word. It is no sufficient objection to say that bhagavati is not a term applied by the natives to a temple; the question is rather what misunderstanding and mispronunciation by foreigners of a native term may probably have given rise to the term? -- (H. Y.)\n Since the above was written, Sir Walter Elliot has kindly furnished a note, of which the following is an extract:-\n \"I took some pains to get at the origin of the word when at Madras, and the conclusion I came to was that it arose from the term used generally for the object of their worship, viz., Bhagavat, 'god'; bhagavati, 'goddess.'\n \"Thus, the Hindu temple with its lofty gopuram or propylon at once attracts attention, and a stranger enquiring what it was, would be told, 'the house or place of Bhagavat.' The village divinity throughout the south is always a form of Durga, or, as she is commonly called, simply 'Devi' (or Bhagavati, 'the goddess'). . . . In like manner a figure of Durga is found on most of the gold Huns (i.e. pagoda coins) current in the Dakhan, and a foreigner inquiring what such a coin was, or rather what was the form stamped upon it, would be told it was 'the goddess,' i.e., it was 'Bhagavati.'\"\n As my friend, Dr. Burnell, can no longer represent his own view, it seems right here to print the latest remarks of his on the subject that I can find. They are in a letter from Tanjore, dated March 10, 1880:-\n \"I think I overlooked a remark of yours regarding my observation that the e in Pagode was pronounced, and that this was a difficulty in deriving it from Bhagavat. In modern Portuguese e is not sounded, but verses show that it was in the 16th century. Now, if there is a final vowel in Pagoda, it must come from Bhagavati; but though the goddess is and was worshipped to a certain extent in S. India, it is by other names (Amma, &c.). Gundert and Kittel give 'Pogodi' as a name of a Durga temple, but assuredly this is no corruption of Bhagavati, but Pagoda! Malay\u0101lam and Tamil are full of such adopted words. Bhagavati is little used, and the goddess is too insignificant to give rise to pagoda as a general name for a temple.\n \"Bhagavat can only appear in the S. Indian languages in its (Skt.) nominative form bhagav\u0101n (Tamil paGuv\u0101n). As such, in Tamil and Malay\u0101lam it equals Vishnu or Siva, which would suit. But pagoda can't be got out of bhagav\u0101n; and if we look to the N. Indian forms, bhagavant, &c., there is the difficulty about the e, to say nothing about the nt.\"\n The use of the word by Barbosa at so early a date as 1516, and its application to a particular class of temples must not be overlooked.\n a.-\n 1516. -- \"There is another sect of people among the Indians of Malabar, which is called Cujaven [Kushavan, Logan, Malabar, i. 115]. . . . Their business is to work at baked clay, and tiles for covering houses, with which the temples and Royal buildings are roofed. . . . Their idolatry and their idols are different from those of the others; and in their houses of prayer they perform a thousand acts of witchcraft and necromancy; they call their temples pagodes, and they are separate from the others.\"- Barbosa, 135. This is from Lord Stanley of Alderley's translation from a Spanish MS. The Italian of Ramusio reads: \"nelle loro orationi fanno molte strigherie e necroma\u0303tie, le quali chiamano Pagodes, differenti assai dall' altre\" (Ramusio, i. f. 308v.). In the Portuguese MS. published by the Lisbon Academy in 1812, the words are altogether absent; and in interpolating them from Ramusio the editor has given the same sense as in Lord Stanley's English.\n 1516. -- \"In this city of Goa, and all over India, there are an infinity of ancient build ings of the Gentiles, and in a small island near this, called Dinari, the Portuguese, in order to build the city, have destroyed an ancient temple called Pagode, which was built with marvellous art, and with ancient figures wrought to the greatest perfection in a certain black stone, some of which remain standing, ruined and shattered, because these Portuguese care nothing about them.

The name applied to the ancient Persian language in that phase which prevailed from the beginning of the Sassanian monarchy to the time when it became corrupted by the influence of Arabic, and the adoption of numerous Arabic words and phrases. The name Pahlavi was adopted by Europeans from the Parsi use. The language of Western Persia in the time of the Achaemenian kings, as preserved in the cuneiform inscriptions of Persepolis, Behistun, and elsewhere, is nearly akin to the dialects of the Zend-Avesta, and is characterised by a number of inflections agreeing with those of the Avesta and of Sanskrit. The dissolution of inflectional terminations is already indicated as beginning in the later Achaemenian inscriptions, and in many parts of the Zend-Avesta; but its course cannot be traced, as there are no inscriptions in Persian language during the time of the Arsacidae; and it is in the inscriptions on rocks and coins of Ardakhsh\u012br-iP\u0101pa\u1e33\u0101n (A.D. 226-240) -- the Ardash\u012br Babag\u0101n of later Persian -- that the language emerges in a form of that which is known as Pahlavi. \"But, strictly speaking, the medieval Persian language is called Pahlavi when it is written in one of the characters used before the invention of the modern Persian alphabet, and in the peculiarly enigmatical mode adopted in Pahlavi writings. . . . Like the Assyrians of old, the Persians of Parthian times appear to have borrowed their writing from a foreign race. But, whereas the Semitic Assyrians adopted a Turanian syllabary, these later Aryan Persians accepted a Semitic alphabet. Besides the alphabet, however, which they could use for spelling their own words, they transferred a certain number of complete Semitic words to their writings as representatives of the corresponding words in their own language. . . . The use of such Semitic words, scattered about in Persian sentences, gives Pahlavi the motley appearance of a compound language. . . . But there are good reasons for supposing that the language was never spoken as it was written. The spoken language appears to have been pure Persian; the Semitic words being merely used as written representatives, or logograms, of the Persian words which were spoken. Thus, the Persians would write malka\u0302n malka\u0302, 'King of Kings,' but they would read sha\u0302ha\u0302n sha\u0302h. . . . As the Semitic words were merely a Pahlavi mode of writing their Persian equivalents (just as 'viz.' is a mode of writing 'namely' in English*), they disappeared with the Pahlavi writing, and the Persians began at once to write all their words with their new alphabet, just as they pronounced them\" (E. W. West, Introd. to Pahlavi Texts, p. xiii.; Sacred Books of the East, vol. v.).\u2020\n Extant Pahlavi writings are confined to those of the Parsis, transla Or our symbol (&), now modified into (&), which is in fact Latin et, but is read 'and.\"\n \"The peculiar mode of writing Pahlavi here alluded to long made the character of the language a standing puzzle for European scholars, and was first satisfactorily explained by Professor Haug, of Munich, in his admirable Essay on the Pahlavi Language, already cited\" (West, p. xii.).\n tions from the Avesta, and others almost entirely of a religious character. Where the language is transcribed, either in the Avesta characters, or in those of the modern Persian alphabet, and freed from the singular system indicated above, it is called Pazand (see PAZEND); a term supposed to be derived from the language of the Avesta, paitizanti, with the meaning 're-explanation.'\n Various explanations of the term Pahlavi have been suggested. It seems now generally accepted as a changed form of the Parthva of the cuneiform inscriptions, the Parthia of Greek and Roman writers. The Parthians, though not a Persian race, were rulers of Persia for five centuries, and it is probable that everything ancient, and connected with the period of their rule, came to be called by this name. It is apparently the same word that in the form pahlav and pahlav\u0101n, &c., has become the appellation of a warrior or champion in both Persian and Armenian, originally derived from that most warlike people the Parthians. (See PULWAUN.) Whether there was any identity between the name thus used, and that of Pahlava, which is applied to a people mentioned often in Sanskrit books, is a point still unsettled. \n The meaning attached to the term Pahlavi by Orientals themselves, writing in Arabic or Persian (exclusive of Parsis), appears to have been 'Old Persian' in general, without restriction to any particular period or dialect. It is thus found applied to the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis. (Derived from West as quoted above, and from Haug's Essays, ed. London, 1878.)\n c. 930. -- \"Quant au mot dirafeh, en pehlvi (al-fahlviya) c'est \u00e0 dire dans la langue primitive de la Perse, il signifie drapeau, pique et \u00e9tendard.\" -- Ma\u1e63'\u016bd\u012b, iii. 252.\n c.

A box-litter for travelling in, with a pole projecting before and behind, which is borne on the shoulders of 4 or 6 men -- 4 always in Bengal, 6 sometimes in the Telugu country.\n The origin of the word is not doubtful, though it is by no means clear how the Portuguese got the exact form which they have handed over to us. The nasal termination may be dismissed as a usual Portuguese addition, such as occurs in mandarin, Ba\u00e7aim (Wasai), and many other words and names as used by them. The basis of all the forms is Skt. parya\u00f1ka, or palya\u00f1ka, 'a bed,' from which we have Hind. and Mahr. palang, 'a bed,' Hind. p\u0101lk\u012b, 'a palankin,' [Telugu pallak\u012b, which is perhaps the origin of the Port. word], Pali pallanko, 'a couch, bed, litter, or palankin' (Childers), and in Javanese and Malay pala\u00f1gki, 'a litter or sedan' (Crawfurd).*\n It is curious that there is a Spanish word palanca (L. Lat. phalanga) for a pole used to carry loads on the shoulders of two bearers (called in Sp. palanquinos); a method of transport more common in the south than in England, though even in old English the thing has a name, viz. 'a cowlestaff' (see N.E.D.). It is just possible that this word (though we do not find it in the Portuguese dictionaries) may have influenced the form in which the early Portuguese visitors to India took up the word.\n The thing appears already in the R\u0101m\u0101yana. It is spoken of by Ibn Batuta and John Marignolli (both c. In Canticles, iii. 9, the \"ferculum quod fecit sibi rex Salomon de lignis Libani\" is in the Hebrew appiryo\u0304n, which has by some been supposed to be Greek FOREI=ON; highly improbable, as the litter came to Greece from the East. Is it possible that the word can be in some way taken from parya\u00f1ka?  The R.V. has palanquin. [See the discussion in Encyclopaedia Biblica, iii. 2804 seq.].\n 1350), but neither uses this Indian name; and we have not found evidence of p\u0101lk\u012b older than Akbar (see Elliot, iv. 515, and \u0100\u012bn, i. 254).\n As drawn by Linschoten (1597), and as described by Grose at Bombay (c. 1760), the palankin was hung from a bamboo which bent in an arch over the vehicle; a form perhaps not yet entirely obsolete in native use. Williamson (V. M., i. 316 seqq.) gives an account of the different changes in the fashion of palankins, from which it would appear that the present form must have come into use about the end of the 18th century. Up to 1840 50 most people in Calcutta kept a palankin and a set of bearers (usually natives of Orissa -- see OORIYA), but the practice and the vehicle are now almost, if not entirely, obsolete among the better class of Europeans. Till the same period the palankin, carried by relays of bearers, laid out by the post-office, or by private chowdries (q.v.), formed the chief means of accomplishing extensive journeys in India, and the elder of the present writers has undergone hardly less than 8000 or 9000 miles of travelling in going considerable distances (excluding minor journeys) after this fashion. But in the decade named, the palankin began, on certain great roads, to be superseded by the dawk-garry (a Palkee-garry or palankincarriage, horsed by ponies posted along the road, under the post-office), and in the next decade to a large extent by railway, supplemented by other wheelcarriage, so that the palankin is now used rarely, and only in out-of-the-way localities.\n c. 1340. -- \"Some time afterwards the pages of the Mistress of the Universe came to me with a d\u016bla. . . . It is like a bed of state . . . with a pole of wood above . . . this is curved, and made of the Indian cane, solid and compact. Eight men, divided into two relays, are employed in turn to carry one of these; four carry the palankin whilst four rest. These vehicles serve in India the same purpose as donkeys in Egypt; most people use them habitually in going and coming. If a man has his own slaves, he is carried by them; if not he hires men to carry him. There are also a few found for hire in the city, which stand in the bazars, at the Sultan's gate, and also at the gates of private citizens.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 386.\n c. 1350. -- \"Et eciam homines et mulieres portant super scapulas in lecticis de quibus in Canticis: ferculum fecit sibi Salomon de lignis Libani, id est lectulum portatilem sicut portabar ego in Zayton et in India.\" -- Marignolli (see Cathay, &c., p. 331).\n 1515. -- \"And so assembling all the people made great lamentation, and so did throughout all the streets the women, married and single, in a marvellous way.

A kind of chintz bed-cover, sometimes made of beautiful patterns, formerly made at various places in India, especially at Sadras and Masulipatam, the importation of which into Europe has become quite obsolete, but under the greater appreciation of Indian manufactures has recently shown some tendency to revive. The etymology is not quite certain, -- we know no place of the name likely to have been the eponymic, -- and possibly it is a corruption of a hybrid (Hind. and Pers.) palangposh, 'a bed-cover,' which occurs below, and which may have been perverted through the existence of Salempore as a kind of stuff.

The name of the sacred language of the Southern Buddhists, in fact, according to their apparently well-founded tradition Magadh\u012b, the dialect of what we now call South Bahar, in which Sakya Muni discoursed. It is one of the Pr\u0101krits (see PRACRIT) or Aryan vernaculars of India, and has probably been a dead language for nearly 2000 years. P\u0101li in Skt. means 'a line, row, series'; and by the Buddhists is used for the series of their Sacred Texts. P\u0101l\u012b-bh\u0101sh\u0101 is then 'the language of the Sacred Texts,' i.e. Magadh\u012b; and this is called elliptically by the Singhalese P\u0101l\u012b, which we have adopted in like use. It has been carried, as the sacred language, to all the Indo-Chinese countries which have derived their religion from India through Ceylon. P\u0101l\u012b is \"a sort of Tuscan among the Pr\u0101krits\" from its inherent grace and strength (Childers). But the analogy to Tuscan is closer still in the parallelism of the modification of Sanskrit words, used in P\u0101l\u012b, to that of Latin words used in Italian.\n Robert Knox does not apparently know by that name the P\u0101l\u012b language in Ceylon. He only speaks of the Books of Religion as \"being in an eloquent style which the Vulgar people do not understand\" (p. 75); and in another passage says: \"They have a language something differing from the vulgar tongue (like Latin to us) which their books are writ in\" (p. 109).\n 1689. -- \"Les uns font valoir le style de leur Alcoran, les autres de leur B\u00e1li.\"- Lettres Edif. xxv. 61.\n 1690. -- \". . . this Doubt proceeds from the Siameses understanding two Languages, viz., the Vulgar, which is a simple Tongue, consisting almost wholly of Monosyllables, without Conjugation or Declension; and another Language, which I have already spoken of, which to them is a dead Tongue, known only by the Learned, which is called the Balie Tongue, and which is enricht with the inflexions of words, like the Languages we have in Europe.

In support of this belief they adduce various arguments, which, in their judgment, are quite conclusive. They observe that the very word P\u00e1li signifies original, text, regularity; and there is scarcely a Buddhist scholar in Ceylon, who, in the discussion of this question, will not quote, with an air of triumph, their favourite verse,-\n S\u00e1 M\u00e1gadhi; m\u00fala bh\u00e1s\u00e1 (&c.).\n 'There is a language which is the root; . . . men and br\u00e1hmans at the commencement of the creation, who never before heard nor uttered a human accent, and even the Supreme Buddhos, spoke it: it is M\u00e1gadhi.'\n \"This verse is a quotation from Kachch\u00e1- yan\u00f3's grammar, the oldest referred to in the P\u00e1li literature of Ceylon. . . .

Then came Dante, and choosing for his immortal Commedia the finest and most cultivated of the vernaculars, raised it at once to the position of dignity which it still retains. Read Sanskrit for Latin, Magadhese for Tuscan, and the Three Baskets for the Divina Commedia, and the parallel is complete. . . . Like Italian Pali is at once flowing and sonorous; it is a characteristic of both languages that nearly every word ends in a vowel, and that all harsh conjunctions are softened down by assimilation, elision, or crasis, while on the other hand both lend themselves easily to the expression of sublime and vigorous thought.\" -- Childers, Preface to Pali Dict. pp. xiii-xiv.\n", "palkee-garry": "s.

The name of a port of Malabar of great reputation in the Middle Ages, a name which has gone through many curious corruptions. Its position is clear enough from Varthema's statement that an uninhabited island stood opposite at three leagues distance, which must be the \"Sacrifice Rock\" of our charts. [The Madras Gloss. identifies it with Collam.] The name appears upon no modern map, but it still attaches to a miserable fishing village on the site, in the form Pantal\u0101n\u012b (approx. lat. 11\u02da 26'), a little way north of Koilandi. It is seen below in Ibn Batuta's notice that Pandar\u0101ni afforded an exceptional shelter to shipping during the S.W. monsoon. This is referred to in an interesting letter to one of the present writers from his friend Col. (now Lt.-Gen.) R. H. Sankey, C.B., R.E., dated Madras, 13th Feby., 1881: \"One very extraordinary feature on the coast is the occurrence of mud-banks in from 1 to 6 fathoms of water, which have the effect of breaking both surf and swell to such an extent that ships can run into the patches of water so sheltered at the very height of the monsoon, when the elements are raging, and not only find a perfectly still sea, but are able to land their cargoes. . . . Possibly the snugness of some of the harbours frequented by the Chinese junks, such as Pandarani, may have been mostly due to banks of this kind?

This book-name for the Manis is Malay Pang\u016blang, 'the creature that rolls itself up.' [Scott says: \"The Malay word is peng-goling, transcribed also pengguling; Katingan pengiling. It means 'roller,' or, more literally, 'roll up.' The word is formed from goling, 'roll, wrap,' with the denominative prefix pe-, which takes before g the form peng.\" Mr. Skeat remarks that the modern Malay form is teng-giling or senggiling, but the latter seems to be used, not for the Manis, but for a kind of centipede which rolls itself up. \"The word pangolin, to judge by its form, should be derived from guling, which means to 'roll over and over.' The word pangguling or pengguling in the required sense of Manis, does not exist in standard Malay. The word was either derived from some out-of-the-way dialect, or was due to some misunderstanding on the part of the Europeans who first adopted it.\" Its use in English begins with Pennant (Synopsis of Quadrupeds, 1771, p. 329). Adam Burt gives a dissection of the animal in Asiat. Res. ii. 353 seqq.] It is the Manis pentedactyla of Linn.; called in Hind. bajrk\u012bt (i.e. Skt. vajraki\u1e6da 'adamant reptile'). We have sometimes thought that the Manis might have been the creature which was shown as a gold-digging ant (see Busbeck below); was not this also the creature that Bertrandon de la Brocqui\u00e8re met with in the desert of Gaza? When pursued, \"it began to cry like a cat at the approach of a dog. Pierre de la Vaudrei struck it on the back with the point of his sword, but it did no harm, from being covered with scales like a sturgeon.\" A.D. 1432. (T. Wright's Early Travels in Palestine, p. 290) (Bohn). It is remarkable to find the statement that these ants were found in the possession of the King of Persia recurring in Herodotus and in Busbeck, with an interval of nearly 2000 years! We see that the suggestion of the Manis being the golddigging ant has been anticipated by Mr. Blakesley in his Herodotus. [\"It is now understood that the gold-digging ants were neither, as ancients supposed, an extraordinary kind of real ants, nor, as many learned men have since supposed, large animals mistaken for ants, but Tibetan miners who, like their descendants of the present day, preferred working their mines in winter when the frozen soil stands well and is not likely to trouble them by falling in.

This is the name applied of late years in Burma, and in intelligence coming from the side of Burma, to the Mahommedans of Yunnan, who established a brief independence at Talifu, between 1867 and 1873. The origin of the name is exceedingly obscure. It is not, as Mr. Baber assures us, used or known in Yunnan itself (i.e. by the Chinese). It must be remarked that the usual Burmese name for a Mahommedan is Path\u00ed, and one would have been inclined to suppose Panth\u00e9 to be a form of the same; as indeed we see that Gen. Fytche has stated it to be (Burma, Past and Present, ii. 297-8). But Sir Arthur Phayre, a high authority, in a note with which he has favoured us, observes: 'Panth\u00e9, I believe, comes from a Chinese word signifying 'native or indigenous.' It is quite a modern name in Burma, and is applied exclusively to the Chinese Mahommedans who come with caravans from Yunnan. I am not aware that they can be distinguished from other Chinese caravan traders, except that they do not bring hams for sale as the others do. In dress and appearance, as well as in drinking samshu (see SAMSHOO) and gambling, they are like the others. The word Pa-thi again is the old Burmese word for 'Mahommedan.' It is applied to all Mahommedans other than the Chinese Panth\u00e9. It is in no way connected with the latter word, but is, I believe, a corruption of P\u0101rs\u012b or F\u0101rs\u012b, i.e. Persian.\" He adds: -- \"The Burmese call their own indigenous Mahommedans 'Pathi-Kul\u00e0,' and Hindus 'Hindu-Kul\u00e0,' when they wish to distinguish between the two\" (see KULA). The last suggestion is highly probable, and greatly to be preferred to that of M. Jacquet, who supposed that the word might be taken from Pasei in Sumatra, which was during part of the later Middle Ages a kind of metropolis of Islam, in the Eastern Seas.*\n We may mention two possible origins for Panth\u00e9, as indicating lines for enquiry:-\n See Journ. As., Ser. II., tom. viii. 352.\n a. The title Path\u00ed (or Pass\u00ed, for the former is only the Burmese lisping utterance) is very old. In the remarkable Chinese Account of Camboja, dating from the year 1296, which has been translated by Abel-R\u00e9musat, there is a notice of a sect in Camboja called Pa-sse. The author identifies them in a passing way, with the Taosse, but that is a term which Fah-hian also in India uses in a vague way, apparently quite inapplicable to the Chinese sect properly so called. These Pa-sse, the Chinese writer says, \"wear a red or white cloth on their heads, like the head-dress of Tartar women, but not so high. They have edifices or towers, monasteries, and temples, but not to be compared for magnitude with those of the Buddhists. . . . In their temples there are no images . . . they are allowed to cover their towers and their buildings with tiles. The Pa-sse never eat with a stranger to their sect, and do not allow themselves to be seen eating; they drink no wine,\" &c. (R\u00e9musat, Nouv. M\u00e9l. As., i. 112). We cannot be quite sure that this applies to Mahommedans, but it is on the whole probable that the name is the same as the Pathi of the Burmese, and has the same application. Now the people from whom the Burmese were likely to adopt a name for the Yunnan Mahommedans are the Shans, belonging to the great Siamese race, who occupy the intermediate country. The question occurs: -- Is Panth\u00e9 a Shan term for Mahommedan? If so, is it not probably only a dialectic variation of the Passe of Camboja, the Path\u00ed of Burma, but entering Burma from a new quarter, and with its identity thus disguised? (Cushing, in his Shan Dict. gives Pas\u012b for Mahommedan. We do not find Panth\u00e9). There would be many analogies to such a course of things.\n [\"The name Panthay is a purely Burmese word, and has been adopted by us from them. The Shan word Pang-hse is identical, and gives us no help to the origin of the term. Among themselves and to the Chinese they are known as Hui-hui or Hui-tzu (Mahomedans).\" -- J. G. Scott, Gazetteer Upper Burma, I. i. 606.]\n b. We find it stated in Lieut. Garnier's narrative of his great expedition to Yunnan that there is a hybrid Chinese race occupying part of the plain of Tali-fu, who are called Pen-ti (see Garnier, Voy. d'Expl. i. 518). This name again, it has been suggested, may possibly have to do with Panth\u00e9. But we find that Pen-ti ('root-soil') is a generic expression used in various parts of S. China for 'aborigines'; it could hardly then have been applied to the Mahommedans. \n", "panwell": "n.p. This town on the mainland opposite Bombay was in pre-railway times a usual landingplace on the way to Poona, and the English form of the name must have struck many besides ourselves. [Hamilton (Descr. ii. 151) says it stands on the river Pan, whence perhaps the name]. We do not know the correct form; but this one has substantially come down to us from the Portuguese: e.g.\n 1644. -- \"This Island of Caranja is quite near, almost frontier-place, to six cities of the Moors of the Kingdom of the Melique, viz.

This word seems to be from America like the insipid, not to say nasty, fruit which it denotes (Carica papaya, L.). A quotation below indicates that it came by way of the Philippines and Malacca. [The Malay name, according to Mr. Skeat, is betik, which comes from the same Ar. form as pateca, though papaya and kapaya have been introduced by Europeans.] Though of little esteem, and though the tree's peculiar quality of rendering fresh meat tender which is familiar in the W. Indies, is little known or taken advantage of, the tree is found in gardens and compounds all over India, as far north as Delhi. In the N.W. Provinces it is called by the native gardeners aran\u1e0d-kharb\u016bza, 'castor-oiltree-melon,' no doubt from the superficial resemblance of its foliage to that of the Palma Christi. According to Moodeen Sheriff it has a Perso-Arabic name 'anbah-i-Hind\u012b; in Canarese it is called P'arangi-ha\u1e47\u1e47u or -mara ('Frank or Portuguese fruit, tree'). The name papaya according to Oviedo as quoted by Littr\u00e9 (\"Oviedo, t. l. p. 333, Madrid, 1851,\" -- we cannot find it in Ramusio) was that used in Cuba, whilst the Carib name was ababai.* [Mr. J. Platt, referring to his article in 9th Ser. Notes & Queries, iv. 515, writes: \"Malay papaya, like the Accra term kpakpa, is a European loan word. The evidence for Carib origin is, firstly, Oviedo's Historia, 1535 (in the ed. of 1851, vol. i. 323): 'Del arbol que en esta isla Espa\u00f1ola llaman papaya, y en la tierra firme los llaman los Espa\u00f1oles los higos del mastuer\u00e7o, y en la provincia de Nicaragua llaman a tal arbol olocoton.' Secondly, Breton, Dictionnaire Caraibe, has: 'Ababai, papayer.' Gilij, Saggio, 1782, iii. 146 (quoted in N. & Q., u.s.), says the Otamic word is pappai.\"] Strange liberties are taken with the spelling. Mr. Robinson (below) calls it popeya; Sir L.

This was the popular name among the Portuguese of a gold coin from the native mints of Western India, which entered largely into the early currency of Goa, and the name of which afterwards attached to a silver money of their own coinage, of constantly degenerating value.\n There could hardly be a better word with which to associate some connected account of the coinage of Portuguese India, as the pardao runs through its whole history, and I give some space to the subject, not with any idea of weaving such a history, but in order to furnish a few connected notes on the subject, and to correct some flagrant errors of writers to whose works I naturally turned for help in such a special matter, with little result except that of being puzzled and misled, and having time occupied in satisfying myself regarding the errors alluded to. The subject is in itself a very difficult one, perplexed as it is by the rarity or inaccessibility of books dealing with it, by the excessive rarity (it would seem) of specimens, by the large use in the Portuguese settlements of a variety of native coins in addition to those from the Goa mint,* by the frequent shifting of nomenclature in the higher coins and constant degeneration of value in the coins that retained old names. I welcomed as a hopeful aid the appearance of Dr. Gerson D'Acunha's Contributions to the Study of Indo-Chinese Numismatics. But though these contributions afford some useful facts and references, on the whole, from the rarity with which they give data for the intrinsic value of the gold and silver coins, and from other defects, they seem to me to leave the subject in utter chaos. Nor are the notes which Mr. W. de G. Birch appends, in regard to monetary values, to his translation of Alboquerque, more to be commended. Indeed Dr. D'Acunha, when he goes astray, seems sometimes to have followed Mr. Birch.\n The word pardao is a Portuguese (or perhaps an indigenous) corruption of Skt. prat\u0101pa, 'splendour, majesty,' &c., and was no doubt taken, as Dr. Antonio Nunez, \"Comtador da Casa del Rey noso Senhor,\" who in 1554 compiled the Livro dos Pesos da Ymdia e asy Medidas e Mohedas, says of Diu in particular:\n \"The moneys here exhibit such variations and such differences, that it is impossible to write any thing certain about them; for every month, every 8 days indeed, they rise and fall in value, according to the money that enters the place\" (p. 28).\n D'Acunha says, from the legend on some of the coins to which the name was applied, e.g. that of the Raja of Ikkeri in Canara: Sri Prat\u0101pa krish\u1e47a-r\u0101ya.\n A little doubt arises at first in determining to what coin the name pardao was originally attached. For in the two earliest occurrences of the word that we can quote -- on the one hand Abdurrazz\u0101k, the Envoy of Sh\u0101h Rukh, makes the part\u0101b (or pard\u0101o) half of the Var\u0101ha ('boar,' so called from the Boar of Vishnu figured on some issues), h\u016bn, or what we call pagoda; -- whilst on the other hand, Ludovico Varthema's account seems to identify the pardao with the pagoda itself. And there can be no doubt that it was to the pagoda that the Portuguese, from the beginning of the 16th century, applied the name of pardao d'ouro. The money-tables which can be directly formed from the statements of Abdurrazz\u0101k and Varthema respectively are as follows:*\n ABDURRAZZAK (A.D. 1443). 3 Jitals (copper) . = 1 Tar (silver). 6 Tars . . . = 1 Fanam (gold). 10 Fanams . . = 1 Part\u0101b. 2 Part\u0101bs . . = 1 Var\u0101ha.\n And the Var\u0101ha weighed about 1 Mith\u1e33\u0101l (see MISCALL), equivalent to 2 d\u012bn\u0101rs Kopek\u012b.\n VARTHEMA (A.D. 1504-5). 16 Cas (see CASH) = 1 Tare (silver). 16 Tare . . = 1 Fanam (gold). 20 Fanams . . = 1 Pardao.\n And the Pardao was a gold ducat, smaller than the seraphim (see XERAFINE) of Cairo (gold d\u012bn\u0101r), but thicker.\n The question arises whether the var\u0101ha of Abdurrazz\u0101k was the double pagoda, of which there are some examples in the S. Indian coinage, and his part\u0101b therefore the same as Varthema's, i.e. the pagoda itself; or whether his var\u0101ha was the pagoda, and his part\u0101b a half-pagoda. The weight which he assigns to the var\u0101ha, \"about one mith\u1e33\u0101l,\" a weight which may be taken at 73 grs., does not well suit either one or the other. I find the mean weight of 27 different issues of the (single) h\u016bn or pagoda, given in Prinsep's Tables, to be 43 grs., the I invert the similar table given by Dr. Badger in his notes to Varthema.\n maximum being 45 grs. And the fact that both the Envoy's var\u0101ha and the Italian traveller's pardao contain 20 fanams is a strong argument for their identity.*\n In further illustration that the pardao was recognised as a half h\u016bn or pagoda, we quote in a foot-note \"the old arithmetical tables in which accounts are still kept\" in the south, which Sir Walter Elliot contributed to Mr. E. Thomas's excellent Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Delhi, illustrated, &c.\u2020\n Moreover, Dr. D'Acunha states that in the \"New Conquests,\" or provinces annexed to Goa only about 100 years ago, \"the accounts were kept until lately in sanvoy and nixane pagodas, each of them being divided into 2 prat\u00e1ps . . . .\" &c. (p. 46, note).\n As regards the value of the pardao d'ouro, when adopted into the Goa currency by Alboquerque, Dr. D'Acunha tells us that it \"was equivalent to 370 reis, or 1s. 6\u00bdd.\u2021 English.\" Yet he accepts the identity of this pardao d'ouro with the h\u016bn current in Western India, of which the Madras pagoda was till 1818 a living and unchanged representative, a coin which was, at the time of its abolition, the recognised equivalent of 3\u00bd rupees, or 7 shillings. And doubtless this, or a few pence more, was the intrinsic value of the pardao. Dr. D'Acunha in fact has made his calculation from the present value of the (imaginary) rei. Seeing that a milrei is now reckoned equal to a dollar, or 50d., we have a single rei=1\u204420d., and 370 reis=1s. 6\u00bdd. It seems not to have occurred to the author that the rei might have degenerated in value as well as every other denomination of money with which he has to do, every other in fact of which we can at this moment remember anything, except the pagoda, The issues of fanams, q.v., have been infinite; but they have not varied much in weight, though very greatly in alloy, and therefore in the number reckoned to a pagoda.\n \"2 gunj\u0101s=1 dugala 2 dugalas = 1 chavula (=the panam or fanam), 2 chavalas=1 ho\u1e47a (=the pratapa, m\u00e1da, or half pagoda, 2 ho\u1e47\u1e47as=1 Var\u0101ha (the h\u016bn or pagoda\").\n \"The ganj\u0101 or unit (=\u00bc fanam) is the rati, or Sanskrit raktika, the seed of the abrus.\" -- Op. cit. p. 224, note. See also Sir W. Elliot's Coins of S. India, p. 56.\n 360 reis is the equivalent in the authorities, so far as I know.\n the Venetian sequin, and the dollar.* Yet the fact of this degeneration everywhere stares him in the face. Correa tells us that the cruzado which Alboquerque struck in 1510 was the just equivalent of 420 reis. It was indubitably the same as the cruzado of the mother country, and indeed A. Nunez (1554) gives the same 420 reis as the equivalent of the cruzado d'ouro de Portugal, and that amount also for the Venetian sequin, and for the sultani or Egyptian gold d\u012bn\u0101r. Nunez adds that a gold coin of Cambaya, which he calls Madrafaxao (q.v.), was worth 1260 to 1440 reis, according to variations in weight and exchange. We have seen that this must have been the gold-mohr of Muzaffar-Sh\u0101h II. of Guzerat (1511-1526), the weight of which we learn from E. Thomas's book.\n From the Venetian sequin (content of pure gold 52\u00b727 grs. value 111d.\u2020) the value of the rei at 11 1\u2044420d. will be . . . . \u00b7264d.\n From the Muzaffar Sh\u0101hi mohr (weight 185 grs. value, if pure gold, 392\u00b752d.) value of rei at 1440 . . . . . . . . . 0\u00b7272d.\n Mean value of rei in 1513 . . . 0\u00b7268d. i.e. more than five times its present value.\n Dr. D'Acunha himself informs us (p. 56) that at the beginning of the 17th century the Venetian was worth 690 to 720 reis (mean 705 reis), whilst Even the pound sterling, since it represented a pound of silver sterlings, has come down to onethird of that value; but if the value of silver goes on dwindling as it has done lately, our pound might yet justify its name again!\n I have remarked elsewhere:\n \"Everybody seems to be tickled at the notion that the Scotch Pound or livre was only 20 pence. Nobody finds it funny that the French or Italian Livre or Pound is only 20 halfpence or less!\" I have not been able to trace how high the rei began, but the maravedi entered life as a gold piece, equivalent to the Saracen mith\u1e33\u0101l, and ended -- ?\n I calculate all gold values in this paper at those of the present English coinage.\n Besides the gradual depreciation of the Portugal re\u012b, so prominently noticed in this paper, there was introduced in Goa a reduction of the rei locally below the rei of Portugal in the ratio of 15 to 8. I do not know the history or understand the object of such a change, nor do I see that it affects the calculations in this article. In a table of values of coins current in Portuguese India, given in the Annaes Maritimos of 1844, each coin is valued both in Reis of Goa and in Reis of Portugal, bearing the above ratio. My kind correspondent, Dr. J. N. Fonseca, author of the capital History of Goa, tells me that this was introduced in the beginning of the 17th century, but that he has yet found no document throwing light upon it. It is a matter quite apart from the secular depreciation of the rei.\n the pagoda was worth 570 to 600 reis (mean 585 reis).\n These statements, as we know the intrinsic value of the sequin, and the approximate value of the pagoda, enable us to calculate the value of the rei of about 1600 at . . . 0\u00b716d. Values of the milrei given in Milburn's Oriental Commerce, and in Kelly's Cambist, enable us to estimate it for the early years of the last century. We have then the progressive deterioration as follows:\n Value of rei in the beginning of the 16th century . . . . 0\u00b7268d. Value of rei in the beginning of the 17th century . . . . 0\u00b716d. Value of rei in the beginning of the 19th century . . 0\u00b706 to 0.066d. Value of rei at present . . . . 0\u00b706d.\n Yet Dr. D'Acunha has valued the coins of 1510, estimated in reis, at the rate of 1880. And Mr. Birch has done the same.*\n The Portuguese themselves do not seem ever to have struck gold pardaos or pagodas. The gold coin of Alboquerque's coinage (1510) was, we have seen, a cruzado (or manuel), and the next coinage in gold was by Garcia de S\u00e1 in 1548-9, who issued coins called San Thom\u00e9, worth 1000 reis, say about \u00a31, 2s. 4d.; with halves and quarters of the same. Neither, according to D'Acunha, was there silver money of any importance coined at Goa from 1510 to 1550, and the coins then issued were silver San Thom\u00e9s, called also Thus Alboquerque, returning to Europe in 1504, gives a \"Moorish\" pilot, who carried him by a new course straight from Cannanore to Mozambique, a buckshish of 50 cruzados; this is explained as \u00a35 -- a mild munificence for such a feat. In truth it was nearly \u00a324, the cruzado being about the same as the sequin (see i. p. 17).\n The mint at Goa was farmed out by the same great man, after the conquest, for 600,000 reis, amounting, we are told, to \u00a3125. It was really \u00a3670 (iii. 41).\n Alboquerque demands as ransom to spare Muscat \"10,000 xerafins of gold.\" And we are told by the translator that this ransom of a wealthy trading city like Muscat amounted to \u00a3625. The coin in question is the ashrafi, or gold d\u012bn\u0101r, as much as, or more than the sequin in value, and the sum more than \u00a35000 (i. p. 82).\n In the note to the first of these cases it is said that the cruzado is \"a silver coin (formerly gold), now equivalent to 480 reis, or about 2s. English money, but probably worth much more relatively in the time of Dalboquerque.\" \"Much more relatively\" means of course that the 2s. had much more purchasing power.\n This is a very common way of speaking, but it is often very fallaciously applied. The change in purchasing power in India generally till the beginning of last century was probably not very great. There is a curious note by Gen. Briggs in his translation of Firishta, comparing the amount stated by Firishta to have been paid by the B\u0101hman\u012b King, about A.D. 1470, as the annual cost of a body of 500 horse, with the cost of a British corps of Irregular horse of the same strength in Briggs's own time (say about 1815). The B\u0101hman\u012b charge was 350,000 Rs.; the British charge 219,000 Rs. A corps of the same strength would now cost the British Government, as near as I can calculate, 287,300 Rs.\n The price of an Arab horse imported into India (then a great traffic) was in Marco Polo's time about three times what it was in our own, up to 1850.\n The salary of the Governor at Goa, c. 1550, was 8000 cruzados, or nearly \u00a34000 a year; and the salaries of the commandants of the fortresses of Goa, of Malacca, of Dio, and of Bassain, 600,000 reis, or about \u00a3670.\n The salary of Ibn Batuta, when Judge of Delhi, about 1340, was 1000 silver tankas or din\u0101rs as he calls them (practically 1000 rupees) a month, which was in addition to an assignment of villages bringing in 5000 tankas a year. And yet he got into debt in a very few years to the tune of 55,000 tankas -- say \u00a35,500!\n patac\u00f5es (see PATACA). Nunez in his Tables (1554) does not mention these by either name, but mentions repeatedly pardaos, which represented 5 silver tangas, or 300 reis, and these D'Acunha speaks of as silver coins. Nunez, as far as I can make out, does not speak of them as coins, but rather implies that in account so many tangas of silver were reckoned as a pardao. Later in the century, however, we learn from Balbi (1580), Barrett* (1584), and Linschoten (1583-89), the principal currency of Goa consisted of a silver coin called xerafin (see XERAFINE) and pardao-xerafin, which was worth 5 tangas, each of 60 reis. (So these had been from the beginning, and so they continued, as is usual in such cases. The scale of sub-multiples remains the same, whilst the value of the divisible coin diminishes. Eventually the lower denominations become infinitesimal, like the maravedis and the reis, and either vanish from memory, or survive only as denominations of account). The data, such as they are, allow us to calculate the pardao or xerafin at this time as worth 4s. 2d. to 4s. 6d.\n A century later, Fryer's statement of equivalents (1676) enables us to use the stability of the Venetian sequin as a gauge; we then find the tanga gone down to 6d. and the pardao or xerafin to 2s. 6d. Thirty years later Lockyer (1711) tells us that one rupee was reckoned equal to 1\u00bd perdo. Calculat Dr. D'Acunha has set this English traveller down to 1684, and introduces a quotation from him in illustration of the coinage of the latter period, in his quasi-chronological notes, a new element in the confusion of his readers.\n ing the Surat Rupee, which may have been probably his standard, still by help of the Venetian (p. 262) at about 2s. 3d., the pardao would at this time be worth 1s. 6d. It must have depreciated still further by 1728, when the Goa mint began to strike rupees, with the effigy of Dom Joa\u0303o V., and the half-rupee appropriated the denomination of pardao. And the halfrupee, till our own time, has continued to be so styled. I have found no later valuation of the Goa Rupee than that in Prinsep's Tables (Thomas's ed. p. 55), the indications of which, taking the Company's Rupee at 2s., would make it 21d. The pardao therefore would represent a value of 10\u00bdd., and there we leave it.\n [On this Mr. Whiteway writes: \"Should it be intended to add a note to this, I would suggest that the remarks on coinage commencing at page 67 of my Rise of the Portuguese Power in India be examined, as although I have gone to Sir H. Yule for much, some papers are now accessible which he does not appear to have seen. There were two pardaos, the pardao d'ouro and the pardao de tanga, the former of 360 reals, the latter of 300. This is clear from the Foral of Goa of Dec. 18, 1758 (India Office MSS. Conselho Ultramarino), which passage is again quoted in a note to Fasc. 5 of the Archiv. Port. Orient. p. 326. Apparently patecoons were originally coined in value equal to the pardao d'ouro, though I say (p. 71) their value is not recorded. The patecoon was a silver coin, and when it was tampered with, it still remained of the nominal value of the pardao d'ouro, and this was the cause of the outcry and of the injury the people of Goa suffered. There were monies in Goa which I have not shown on p. 69. There was the tanga branca used in revenue accounts (see Nunez, p. 31), nearly but not quite double the ordinary tanga. This money of account was of 4 barganims (see BARGANY) each of 24 bazarucos (see BUDGROOK), that is rather over 111 reals. The whole question of coinage is difficult, because the coins were continually being tampered with. Every ruler, and they were numerous in those days, stamped a piece of metal at his pleasure, and the trader had to calculate its value, unless as a subject of the ruler he was under compulsion. \"]\n 1444. -- \"In this country (Vijayanagar) they have three kinds of money, made of gold mixed with alloys: one called varahah weighs about one mithkal, equivalent to two dinars kopeki; the second, which is called pertab, is the half of the first; the third, called fanom, is equivalent in value to the tenth part of the last-mentioned coin. Of these different coins the fanom is the most useful. . . .\" -- Abdurrazz\u0101k, in India in the XVth Cent. p. 26.\n c. 1504-5; pubd. 1510. -- \"I departed from the city of Dabuli aforesaid, and went to another island, which . . . is called Goga (Goa) and which pays annually to the King of Decan 19,000 gold ducats, called by them pardai.

Now all these the Governor sent to have weighed and assayed. And he caused to be made cruzados of their proper weight of 420 reis, on which he figured on one side the cross of Christ, and on the other a sphere, which was the device of the King Dom Manuel; and he ordered that this cruzado should pass in the place (Goa) for 480 reis, to prevent their being exported . . . and he ordered silver money to be struck which was of the value of a bargany; on this money he caused to be figured on one side a Greek A, and on the other side a sphere, and gave the coin the name of Espera; it was worth 2 vintems; also there were half esperas worth one vintem; and he made bazarucos of copper of the weight belonging to that coin, with the A and the sphere; and each bazaruco he divided into 4 coins which they called cepayquas (see SAPECA), and gave the bazarucos the name of leaes.

The actual pagodas of gold are also mentioned by Balbi, but these were worth, new ones 7\u00bd and old ones 8 tangas of good money.\n English, but I am sorry to say that I find it is a mere translation of the notes of Gasparo Balbi, who was at Goa in 1580. We learn from Balbi that there were at Goa tangas not only of good money worth 75 basarucchi, and of bad money worth 60 basarucchi, but also of another kind of bad money used in buying wood, worth only 50 basarucchi!\n 1598. -- \"The principall and commonest money is called Pardaus Xeraphiins, and is silver, but very brasse (read 'base'), and is coyned in Goa.

We gather from the passage (including a part that we have omitted) that in the latter part of the 16th century there were really no national coins there used intermediate between the basaruccho, worth at this time 0\u00b7133d., and the pardao xerafin worth 50d.* The vintens and tangas that were nominally interposed were mere names for certain quantities of basaruccos, or rather of reis represented by basaruccos.

The name of a northern suburb of Bombay where stands the residence of the Governor. The statement in the Imperial Gazetteer that Mr. W. Hornby (1776) was the first Governor who took up his residence at Parell requires examination, as it appears to have been so occupied in Grose's time. The 2nd edition of Grose, which we use, is dated 1772, but he appears to have left India about 1760. It seems probable that in the following passage Niebuhr speaks of 1763-4, the date of his stay at Bombay, but as the book was not published till 1774, this is not absolutely certain. Evidently Parell was occupied by the Governor long before 1776.\n \"Les Jesuites avoient autrefois un beau couvent aupres du Village de Parell au milieu de l'Isle, mais il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs ann\u00e9es, qu'elle est devenue la maison de campagne du Gouverneur, et l'Eglise est actuellement une magnifique salle \u00e0 manger et de danse, qu'on n'en trouve point de pareille en toutes les Indes.\" -- Niebuhr, Voyage, ii. 12.\n [Mr. Douglas (Bombay and W. India, ii. 7, note) writes: \"High up and outside the dining-room, and which was the chapel when Parel belonged to the Jesuits, is a plaque on which is printed: -- 'Built by Honourable Hornby, 1771.'\"]\n 1554. -- Parell is mentioned as one of 4 aldeas, \"Parell, Varella, Varell, and Siva, attached to the Kasbah (Ca\u00e7abe -- see CUSBAH) of Maim.\" -- Botelho, Tombo, 157, in Subsidios.\n c. 1750-60. -- \"A place called Parell, where the Governor has a very agreeable country-house, which was originally a No doubt, however, foreign coins were used to make up sums, and reduce the bulk of small change.\n Romish chapel belonging to the Jesuits, but confiscated about the year 1719, for some foul practices against the English interest. \" -- Grose, i. 46; [1st ed. 1757, p. 72].\n", "pariah": "&c., s.\n a. The name of a low caste of Hindus in Southern India, constituting one of the most numerous castes, if not the most numerous, in the Tamil country. The word in its present shape means properly 'a drummer.' Tamil parai is the large drum, beaten at certain festivals, and the hereditary beaters of it are called (sing.) paraiyan, (pl.) paraiyar. [Dr. Oppert's theory (Orig. Inhabitants, 32 seq.) that the word is a form of Paha\u1e5biy\u0101, 'a mountaineer' is not probable.] In the city of Madras this caste forms one fifth of the whole population, and from it come (unfortunately) most of the domestics in European service in that part of India. As with other castes low in caste-rank they are also low in habits, frequently eating carrion and other objectionable food, and addicted to drink. From their coming into contact with and under observation of Europeans, more habitually than any similar caste, the name Pariah has come to be regarded as applicable to the whole body of the lowest castes, or even to denote outcastes or people without any caste. But this is hardly a correct use. There are several castes in the Tamil country considered to be lower than the Pariahs, e.g. the caste of shoemakers, and the lowest caste of washermen. And the Pariah deals out the same disparaging treatment to these that he himself receives from higher castes. The Pariahs \"constitute a well-defined, distinct, ancient caste, which has 'subdivisions' of its own, its own peculiar usages, its own traditions, and its own jealousy of the encroachments of the castes which are above it and below it. They constitute, perhaps, the most numerous caste in the Tamil country. In the city of Madras they number 21 per cent. of the Hindu people.\" -- Bp. Caldwell, u. i., p. 545. Sir Walter Elliot, however, in the paper referred to further on includes under the term Paraiya all the servile class not recognised by Hindus of caste as belonging to their community.\n clusive, discussion of the ethnological position of this class will be found in Bp. Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar (pp. 540-554). That scholar's deduction is, on the whole, that they are probably Dravidians, but he states, and recognises force in, arguments for believing that they may have descended from a race older in the country than the proper Dravidian, and reduced to slavery by the first Dravidians. This last is the view of Sir Walter Elliot, who adduces a variety of interesting facts in its favour, in his paper on the Characteristics of the Population of South India.*\n Thus, in the celebration of the Festival of the Village Goddess, prevalent all over Southern India, and of which a remarkable account is given in that paper, there occurs a sort of Saturnalia in which the Pariahs are the officiating priests, and there are several other customs which are most easily intelligible on the supposition that the Pariahs are the representatives of the earliest inhabitants and original masters of the soil. In a recent communication from this venerable man he writes: 'My brother (Col. C. Elliot, C.B.) found them at Raipur, to be an important and respectable class of cultivators. The Pariahs have a sacerdotal order amongst themselves.' [The view taken in the Madras Gloss. is that \"they are distinctly Dravidian without fusion, as the Hinduized castes are Dravidian with fusion.\"]\n The mistaken use of pariah, as synonymous with out-caste, has spread in English parlance over all India. Thus the lamented Prof. Blochmann, in his School Geography of India: \"Outcasts are called pariahs.\" The name first became generally known in Europe through Sonnerat's Travels Sir W. Elliot refers to the A\u015boka inscription (Edict II.) as bearing Palaya or Paraya, named with Cho\u1e0da (or Chola), Kerala, &c., as a country or people \"in the very centre of the Dravidian group . . . a reading which, if it holds good, supplies a satisfactory explanation of the origin of the Paria name and nation\" (in J. Ethnol. Soc. N.S., 1869, p. 103). But apparently the reading has not held good, for M. Senart reads the name P\u0101m\u0303dya (see Ind. Ant. ix. 287). [Mr. V. A. Smith writes: \"The Girnar text is very defective in this important passage, which is not in the Dhauli text; that text gives only 11 out of the 14 edicts. The capital of the P\u0101m\u0303diyan Kingdom was Madura. The history of the kingdom is very imperfectly known. For a discussion of it see Sewell, Lists of Antiquities, Madras, vol. ii. Of course it has nothing to do with Parias.\"]\n (pub. in 1782, and soon after translated into English). In this work the Parias figure as the lowest of castes. The common use of the term is however probably due, in both France and England, to the appearance in the Abb\u00e9 Raynal's famous Hist. Philosophique des \u00c9tablissements dans les Indes, formerly read very widely in both countries, and yet more perhaps to its use in Bernardin de St. Pierre's preposterous though once popular tale, La Chaumi\u00e8re Indienne, whence too the misplaced halo of sentiment which reached its acme in the drama of Casimir Delavigne, and which still in some degree adheres to the name. It should be added that Mr. C. P. Brown says expressly: \"The word Paria is unknown\"'(in our sense?) \"to all natives, unless as learned from us.\"\n b. See PARIAH-DOG.\n 1516. -- \"There is another low sort of Gentiles, who live in desert places, called Pareas. These likewise have no dealings with anybody, and are reckoned worse than the devil, and avoided by everybody; a man becomes contaminated by only looking at them, and is excommunicated. . . . They live on the imane (iname, i.e. yams), which are like the root of iucca or batate found in the West Indies, and on other roots and wild fruits.\" -- Barbosa, in Ramusio, i. f. 310.

Similarly, the pillardollars are called in modern Egypt ab\u016b medfa', 'father of a cannon'; and the Maria Theresa dollar ab\u016b \u1e6d\u0113ra, 'father of the bird.' But on the Red Sea, where only the coinage of one particular year (or the modern imitation thereof, still struck at Trieste from the old die), is accepted, it is ab\u016b nu\u1e33\u0101\u1e6d, 'father of dots,' from certain little points which mark the right issue.\n [1528. -- \"Each of the men engaged in the attack on Purakkat received no less than 800 gold Pattaks (ducats) as his share.\"- Logan, Malabar, i. 329.\n [1550. -- \"And afterwards while Viceroy Dom Affonso Noronha ordered silver coins to be made, which were patecoons (patecoes).\" -- Arch.

In the Bengal Presidency, before the general construction of 'married quarters' by Government, patchar\u00e9e was the name applied in European corps to the cottages which used to form the quarters of married soldiers. The origin of the word is obscure, and it has been suggested that it was a corruption of Hind. pichch'h\u0101r\u012b, 'the rear,' because these cottages were in rear of the barracks. But we think it most likely that the word was brought, with many other terms peculiar to the British soldier in India, from Madras, and is identical with a term in use there, parcherry or patcherry, which represents the Tam. parash'sh\u0113ri, parai\u00e7\u00e7eri, 'a Pariah village,' or rather the quarter or outskirts of a town or village where the Pariahs reside. Mr. Whitworth (s.v. Patcherry) says that \"in some native regiments the term denotes the married sepoys' quarters, possibly because Pariah sepoys had their families with them, while the higher castes left them at home.\" He does not say whether Bombay or Madras sepoys are in question.

In Beng. pachap\u0101t; Deccani Hind. pachol\u012b. The latter are trade names of the dried leaves of a labiate plant allied to mint (Pogostemon patchouly, Pelletier). It is supposed to be a cultivated variety of Pogostemon Heyneanus, Bentham, a native of the Deccan. It is grown in native gardens throughout India, Ceylon, and the Malay Islands, and the dried flowering spikes and leaves of the plant, which are used, are sold in every bazar in Hindustan. The pacha-p\u0101t is used as an ingredient in tobacco for smoking, as hair-scent by women, and especially for stuffing mattresses and laying among clothes as we use lavender. In a fluid form patchouli was introduced into England in 1844, and soon became very fashionable as a perfume.\n The origin of the word is a difficulty. The name is alleged in Drury, and in Forbes Watson's Nomenclature to be Beng\u0101li. Littr\u00e9 says the word patchouli is patchey-elley, 'feuille de patchey'; in what language we know not; perhaps it is from Tamil pachcha, 'green,' and \u00eala\u0302, \u00ealam, an aromatic perfume for the hair. [The Madras Gloss. gives Tamil pa\u00e7\u00e7ilai, pa\u00e7\u00e7ai, 'green,' ilai, 'leaf.']\n 1673. -- \"Note, that if the following Goods from Acheen hold out the following Rates, the Factor employed is no further responsible.\n * * * * * Patch Leaf, 1 Bahar Maunds 7 20 sear.\" -- Fryer, 209.\n", "pateca": "s. This word is used by the Portuguese in India for a watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris, Schrader; Cucurbita Citrullus, L.). It is from the Ar. al-ba\u1e6d\u1e6dikh or al-bi\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh. F. Johnson gives this 'a melon, musk-melon. A pumpkin; a cucurbitaceous plant.' We presume that this is not merely the too common dictionary looseness, for the chaos of cucurbitaceous nomenclature, both vulgar and scientific, is universal (see A. De Candolle, Origine des Plantes cultiv\u00e9es). In Lane's Modern Egyptians (ed. 1837, i. 200) the word butteekh is rendered explicitly 'water-melon.' We have also in Spanish albadeca, which is given by Dozy and Eng. as 'esp\u00e8ce de melon'; and we have French past\u00e8que, which we believe always means a water-melon. De Candolle seems to have no doubt that the water-melon was cultivated in ancient Egypt, and believes it to have been introduced into the Graeco-Roman world about the beginning of our era; whilst Hehn carries it to Persia from India, 'whether at the time of the Arabian or of the Mongol domination, (and then) to Greece, through the medium of the Turks, and to Russia, through that of the Tartar States of Astrakan and Kazan.'\n The name pateca, looking to the existence of the same word in Spanish, we should have supposed to have been Portuguese long before the Portuguese establishment in India; yet the whole of what is said by Garcia de Orta is inconsistent with this. In his Colloquio XXXVI. the gist of the dialogue is that his visitor from Europe, Ruano, tells how he had seen what seemed a most beautiful melon, and how Garcia's housekeeper recommended it, but on trying it, it tasted only of mud instead of melon! Garcia then tells him that at Diu, and in the B\u0101lagh\u0101t, &c., he would find excellent melons with the flavour of the melons of Portugal but \"those others which the Portuguese here in India call patecas are quite another thing -- huge round or oval fruits, with black seeds -- not sweet (doce) like the Portugal melons, but bland (suave), most juicy and cooling, excellent in bilious fevers, and congestions of the liver and kidneys, &c.\" Both name and thing are represented as novelties to Ruano. Garcia tells him also that the Arabs and Persians call it batiec indi, i.e. melon of India (F. Johnson gives 'bi\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh-ihind\u012b, the citrul'; whilst in Persian hinduw\u0101na is also a word for watermelon) but that the real Indian country name was (calangari Mahr. k\u0101linga\u1e5b, [perhaps that known in the N.W.P. as kalind\u0101, 'a water-melon']). Ruano then refers to the budiecas of Castille of which he had heard, and queries if these were not the same as these Indian patecas, but Garcia says they are quite different. All this is curious as implying that the watermelon was strange to the Portuguese at that time (1563; see Colloquios, f. 141v. seqq.).\n [A friend who has Burnell's copy of Garcia De Orta tells me that he finds a note in the writing of the former on bateca: \"i.e. the Arabic term. As this is used all over India, watermelons must have been imported by the Mahommedans.\" I believe it to be a mistake that the word is in use all over India. I do not think the word is ever used in Upper India, nor is it (in that sense) in either Shakespear or Fallon. [Platts gives: A. bitt\u012bkh, s.m. The melon (kharb\u016bza); the watermelon, Cucurbita citrullus.] The most common word in the N.W.P. for a water-melon is Pers. tarb\u016bz, whilst the musk-melon is Pers. kharb\u016bza. And these words are so rendered from the \u0100\u012bn respectively by Blochmann (see his E.T. i. 66, \"melons. . . watermelons, \" and the original i. 67, \"kharbuza. . . tarbuz\"). But with the usual chaos already alluded to, we find both these words interpreted in F. Johnson as \"water-melon.\" And according to Hehn the latter is called in the Slav tongues arbuz and in Mod. Greek KARPOU/SIA, the first as well as the last probably from the Turkish \u1e33\u0101rp\u016bz, which has the same meaning, for this hard \u1e33 is constantly dropt in modern pronunciation. -- H. Y.]\n We append a valuable note on this from Prof. Robertson-Smith:\n \"(1) The classical form of the Ar. word is bi\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh. Ba\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh is a widelyspread vulgarism, indeed now, I fancy, universal, for I don't think I ever heard the first syllable pronounced with an i.\n \"(2) The term, according to the law-books, includes all kinds of melons (Lane); but practically it is applied (certainly at least in Syria and Egypt) almost exclusively to the water-melon, unless it has a limiting adjective. Thus \"the wild bi\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh\" is the colocynth, and with other adjectives it may be used of very various cucurbitaceous fruits (see examples in Dozy's Suppt.)\n \"(6) The biblical form is \u0103ba\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh (e.g. Numbers xi. 5, where the E.V. has 'melons'). But this is only the 'water-melon'; for in the Mishna it is distinguished from the sweet melon, the latter being named by a mere transcription in Hebrew letters of the Greek MHLOPE/PWN. L\u00f6w justly concludes that the Palestinians (and the Syrians, for their name only differs slightly) got the sweet melon from the Greeks, whilst for the water-melon they have an old and probably true Semitic word. For ba\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh Syriac has pa\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bkh, indicating that in literary Arabic the a has been changed to i, only to agree with rules of grammar. Thus popular pronunciation seems always to have kept the old form, as popular usage seems always to have used the word mainly in its old specific meaning. The Bible and the Mishna suffice to refute Hehn's view (of the introduction of the water-melon from India). Old \u1e32im\u1e25i, in his Miklol, illustrates the Hebrew word by the Spanish budiecas.\"\n 1598. -- \". . . ther is an other sort like Melons, called Patecas or Angurias, or Melons of India, which are outwardlie of a darke greene colour; inwardlie white with blacke kernels; they are verie waterish and hard to byte, and so moyst, that as a man eateth them his mouth is full of water, but yet verie sweet and verie cold and fresh meat, wherefore manie of them are eaten after dinner to coole men.\" -- Linschoten, 97; [Hak.

In this use the word occurs only in the older writers, especially Portuguese.\n b. A kind of lateen-rigged ship, with one, two, or three masts, common on the west coast. This sense seems to be comparatively modern. In both senses the word is perhaps the Konkani path-m\u0101r, 'a courier.' C. P. Brown, however, says that patta-mar, applied to a vessel, is Malay\u0101l. signifying \"goose-wing.\" Molesworth's Mahr. Dict. gives both patem\u0101r\u012b and phatem\u0101r\u012b for \"a sort of swift-sailing vessel, a pattymar,\" with the etym. \"tidingsbringer.\" Patta is 'tidings,' but the second part of the word so derived is not clear. Sir. J. M. Campbell, who is very accurate, in the Bo. Gazetteer writes of the vessel as p\u0101tim\u0101r, though identifying, as we have done, both uses with pathm\u0101r, 'courier.' The Moslem, he says, write phatem\u0101r\u012b quasi fat\u1e25-m\u0101r, 'snake of victory' (?). [The Madras Gloss. gives Mal. pattam\u0101ri, Tam. p\u0101ttim\u0101r, from pat\u0101r, Hind.

It is difficult to derive from memory an exact definition of tents, and especially of the difference between pawl and shooldarry. A reference to India failed in getting a reply. The shooldarry is not essentially different from the pawl, but is trimmer, tauter, better closed, and sometimes has two flies. [The names of tents are used in various senses in different parts. The Madras Gloss. defines a paul as \"a small tent with two light poles, a ridge bar, and steep sloping sides; the walls, if any, are very short, often not more than 6 inches high. Sometimes a second ridge above carries a second roof over the first; this makes a common shooting tent.\" Mr. G. R. Dampier writes: \"These terms are, I think, used rather loosely in the N.W.P. Shold\u0101r\u012b generally means a servant's tent, a sort of tente d'abri, with very low sides: the sides are generally not more than a foot high; there are no doors only flaps at one end. P\u0101l is generally used to denote a sleeping tent for Europeans; the roof slopes on both sides from a longitudinal ridge-pole; the sides are much higher than in the shold\u0101r\u012b, and there is a door at one end; the fly is almost invariably single. The Raoti (see ROWTEE) is incorrectly used in some places to denote a sleeping p\u0101l; it is, properly speaking, I believe, a larger tent, of the same kind, but with doors in the side, not at the end. In some parts I have found they use the word p\u0101l as equivalent to shold\u0101r\u012b and bil\u1e6dan (? bell-tent).\"]\n 1785. -- \"Where is the great quantity of baggage belonging to you, seeing that you have nothing besides tents, pawls, and other such necessary articles?\" -- Tippoo's Letters, p. 49.\n 1793. -- \"There were not, I believe, more than two small Pauls, or tents, among the whole of the deputation that escorted us from Patna.\" -- Kirkpatrick's Nepaul, p. 118.\n [1809. -- \"The shops which compose the Bazars, are mostly formed of blankets or coarse cloth stretched over a bamboo, or some other stick for a ridge-pole, supported at either end by a forked stick fixed in the ground.

Hind. p\u012bpal, Skt. pippala, Ficus religiosa, L.; one of the great fig-trees of India, which often occupies a prominent place in a village, or near a temple. The P\u012bpal has a strong resemblance, in wood and foliage, to some common species of poplar, especially the aspen, and its leaves with their long footstalks quaver like those of that tree. This trembling is popularly attributed to spirits agitating each leaf. And hence probably the name of 'Devil's tree' given to it, according to Rheede (Hort. Mal. i. 48), by Christians in Malabar. It is possible therefore that the name is identical with that of the poplar. Nothing would be more natural than that the Aryan immigrants, on first seeing this Indian tree, should give it the name of the poplar which they had known in more northern latitudes (popul-us, pappel, &c.). Indeed, in Kum\u0101on, a true sp. of poplar (Populus ciliata) is called by the people garpipal (qu. ghar, or 'house'-peepul? [or rather perhaps as another name for it is pah\u0101\u1e5b\u012b, from gir, giri, 'a mountain']). Dr. Stewart also says of this Populus: \"This tree grows to a large size, occasionally reaching. 10 feet in girth, and from its leaves resembling those of the pipal . . . is frequently called by that name by plainsmen\" (Punjab Plants, p. 204). A young peepul was shown to one of the present writers in a garden at Palermo as populo delle Indie. And the recognised name of the peepul in French books appears to be peuplier d'Inde. Col. Tod notices the resemblance (Rajasthan, i. 80), and it appears that Vahl called it Ficus populifolia. (See also Geograph.Magazine, ii. 50). In Balfour's Indian Cyclopaedia it is called by the same name in translation, 'the poplar-leaved Fig-tree.' We adduce these facts the more copiously perhaps because the suggestion of the identity of the names pippala and populus was somewhat scornfully rejected by a very learned scholar. The tree is peculiarly destructive to buildings, as birds drop the seeds in the joints of the masonry, which becomes thus penetrated by the spreading roots of the tree. This is alluded to in a quotation below. \"I remember noticing among many Hindus, and especially among Hinduized Sikhs, that they often say P\u012bpal ko j\u0101t\u0101 h\u016b\u1e45 ('I am going to the Peepul Tree'), to express 'I am going to say my prayers.'\" (Lt.-Col.

The name which we give to the Kingdom which formerly existed in the Delta of the Irawadi, to the city which was its capital, and to the British province which occupies its place. The Burmese name is Bag\u00f3. This name belongs to the Talaing language, and is popularly alleged to mean 'conquered by stratagem,' to explain which a legend is given; but no doubt this is mere fancy. The form Pegu, as in many other cases of our geographical nomenclature, appears to come through the Malays, who call it Paig\u016b. The first European mention that we know of is in Conti's narrative (c. 1440) where Poggio has Latinized it as Pauco-nia; but Fra Mauro, who probably derived this name, with much other new knowledge, from Conti, has in his great map (c. 1459) the exact Malay form Paigu. Nikitin (c. 1475) has, if we may depend on his translator into English, Pegu, as has Hieronimo di S. Stefano (1499). The Roteiro of Vasco da Gama (1498) has Peg\u00fao, and describes the land as Christian, a mistake arising no doubt from the use of the ambiguous term K\u0101fir by his Mahommedan informants (see under CAFFER). Varthema (1510) has Pego, and Giov. da Empoli (1514) Pec\u00f9; Barbosa (1516) again Paygu; but Pegu is the usual Portuguese form, as in Barros, and so passed to us.\n 1498. -- \"Peg\u00fao is a land of Christians, and the King is a Christian; and they are all white like us.

But before many years the Mongol capital was rehabilitated as the imperial residence, and became Pe-King accordingly. Its preparation for reoccupation began in 1409.

This word, in its proper application to the Pelicanus onocrotalus, L., is in no respect peculiar to Anglo-India, though we may here observe that the bird is called in Hindi by the poetical name gagan-bher, i.e. 'Sheep of the Sky,' which we have heard natives with their strong propensity to metathesis convert into the equally appropriate Gang\u0101-bhe\u1e5b\u012b or 'Sheep of the Ganges.' The name may be illustrated by the old term 'Cape-sheep' applied to the albatross.* But Pelican is habitually misapplied by the British soldier in India to the bird usually called Adjutant (q.v.). We may remember how Prof. Max M\u00fcller, in his Lectures on Language, tells us that the Tahitians show respect to their sovereign by ceasing to employ in common language those words which form part or the whole of his name, and invent new terms to supply their place. \"The object was clearly to guard against the name of the sovereign being ever used, even by accident, in ordinary conversation,\" 2nd ser. 1864, p. 35, [Frazer, Golden Bough, 2nd ed. i. 421 seqq.]). Now, by an analogous process, it is possible that \". . . great diversion is found . . . in flring balls at birds, particularly the albitross, a large species of the swan, commonly seen within two or three hundred miles round the Cape of Good Hope, and which the French call Montons (Moutons) du Cap.\" -- Munro's Narrative, 13. The confusion of genera here equals that mentioned in our article above.\n some martinet, holding the office of adjutant, at an early date in the Anglo-Indian history, may have resented the ludicrously appropriate employment of the usual name of the bird, and so may have introduced the entirely inappropriate name of pelican in its place. It is in the recollection of one of the present writers that a worthy northern matron, who with her husband had risen from the ranks in the -- th Light Dragoons, on being challenged for speaking of \"the pelicans in the barrack-yard,\" maintained her correctness, conceding only that \"some ca'd them paylicans, some ca'd them audjutants.\"\n 1829. -- \"This officer . . . on going round the yard (of the military prison) . . . discovered a large beef-bone recently dropped. The sergeant was called to account for this ominous appearance. This sergeant was a shrewd fellow, and he immediately said,- 'Oh Sir, the pelicans have dropped it.' This was very plausible, for these birds will carry enormous bones; and frequently when fighting for them they drop them, so that this might very probably have been the case. The moment the dinner-trumpet sounds, whole flocks of these birds are in attendance at the barrack-doors, waiting for bones, or anything that the soldiers may be pleased to throw to them.\" -- Mem. of John Shipp, ii. 25.\n", "penang": "n.p. This is the proper name of the Island adjoining the Peninsula of Malacca (Pulo, properly Pulau, Pinang), which on its cession to the English (1786) was named 'Prince of Wales's Island.' But this official style has again given way to the old name. Pinang in Malay signifies an areca-nut or areca-tree, and, according to Crawfurd, the name was given on account of the island's resemblance in form to the fruit of the tree (vulgo, 'the betel-nut').\n 1592. -- \"Now the winter coming vpon vs with much contagious weather, we directed our course from hence with the Ilands of Pulo Pinaou (where by the way is to be noted that Pulo in the Malaian tongue signifieth an Iland) . . . where we came to an anker in a very good harborough betweene three Ilands. . . .

The sticks are prepared by scraping the young stem with glass, so as to remove the epidermis and no more. The sticks are then straightened by fire and polished (Balfour). The name is popularly thought to have originated in a jocular supposition that law-suits in Penang were decided by the lex baculina.  But there can be little doubt that it is a corruption of some native term, and pinang liyar, 'wild areca' [or pinang l\u0101yor, \"fire-dried areca,\" which is suggested in N.E.D.], may almost be assumed to be the real name.

It was originally used in the sense of 'a foot-soldier'; thence as 'orderly' or messenger. The word Sepoy was used within our recollection, and perhaps is still, in the same sense in the city of Bombay. The transition of meaning comes out plainly in the quotation from Ives. In the sense of 'orderly,' peon is the word usual in S. India, whilst chuprassy (q.v.) is more common in N. India, though peon is also used there. The word is likewise very generally employed for men on police service (see BURKUNDAUZE). [Mr. Skeat notes that Piyun is used in the Malay States, and Tambi or Tanby at Singapore].

The original of this word, Skt. pippali, means not the ordinary pepper of commerce ('black pepper') but long pepper, and the Sanskrit name is still so applied in Bengal, where one of the long-pepper plants, which have been classed sometimes in a different genus (Chavica) from the black pepper, was at one time much cultivated. There is still indeed a considerable export of long pepper from Calcutta; and a kindred species grows in the Archipelago. Long pepper is mentioned by Pliny, as well as white and black pepper; the three varieties still known in trade, though with the kind of error that has persisted on such subjects till quite recently, he misapprehends their relation. The proportion of their ancient prices will be found in a quotation below.\n The name must have been transferred by foreign traders to black pepper, the staple of export, at an early date, as will be seen from the quotations. Pippalim\u016bla, the root of long pepper, still a stimulant medicine in the native pharmacopoeia, is probably the PEPE/REWS R(I/ZA of the ancients (Royle, p. 86).\n We may say here that Black pepper is the fruit of a perennial climbing shrub, Piper nigrum, L., indigenous in the forests of Malabar and Travancore, and thence introduced into the Malay countries, particularly Sumatra.\n White pepper is prepared from the black by removing the dark outer layer of pericarp, thereby depriving it of a part of its pungency. It comes chiefly via\u0302 Singapore from the Dutch settlement of Rhio, but a small quan tity of fine quality comes from Tellicherry in Malabar.\n Long pepper is derived from two shrubby plants, Piper officinarum, C.D.C., a native of the Archipelago, and Piper longum, L., indigenous in Malabar, Ceylon, E. Bengal, Timor, and the Philippines. Long pepper is the fruit - spike gathered and dried when not quite ripe (Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger, Pharmacographia). All these kinds of pepper were, as has been said, known to the ancients.\n c. 70 A.D. -- \"The cornes or graines . . . lie in certaine little huskes or cods. . . . If that be plucked from the tree before they gape and open of themselves, they make that spice which is called Long pepper; but if as they do ripen, they cleave and chawne by little and little, they shew within the white pepper: which afterwards beeing parched in the Sunne, chaungeth colour and waxeth blacke, and therewith riveled also . . . Long pepper is soone sophisticated, with the senvie or mustard seed of Alexandria: and a pound of it is worth fifteen Roman deniers. The white costeth seven deniers a pound, and the black is sold after foure deniers by the pound.\" -- Pliny, tr. by Phil. Holland, Bk. xii. ch. 7.\n c. 80-90. -- \"And there come to these marts great ships, on account of the bulk and quantity of pepper and malabathrum. . . . The pepper is brought (to market) here, being produced largely only in one district near these marts, that which is called Kottonarik\u0113. \" -- Periplus, \u0015 56.\n c.

An additional allowance or percentage, added as a handicap to the weight of goods, which varied with every description, -- and which the editor of the Subsidios supposes to have lead to the varieties of bahar (q.v.). Thus at Ormuz the bahar was of 20 farazolas (see FRAZALA), to which was added, as picota, for cloves and mace 3 maunds (of Ormuz), or about 1\u204472 additional; for cinnamon 1\u204420 additional; for benzoin \u2155 additional, &c.

We have not been able to trace the origin of this term, nor any modern use.\n [1554. -- \"Picotaa.\" (See under BRAZIL- WOOD, DOOCAUN.)]\n", "picottah": "s. This is the term applied in S.

It is the \u1e0dhenkl\u012b of Upper India, the sh\u0101d\u016bf of the Nile, and the old English sweep, swape, or sway-pole. The machine is we believe still used in the Terra Incognita of market-gardens S.E. of London. The name is Portuguese, picota, a marine term now applied to the handle of a ship's pump and post in which it works -- a 'pump-brake.' The picota at sea was also used as a pillory, whence the employment of the word as quoted from Correa. The word is given in the Glossary attached to the \"Fifth Report\" (1812), but with no indication of its source. Fryer (1673, pub. 1698) describes the thing without giving it a name. In the following the word is used in the marine sense:\n 1524. -- \"He (V. da Gama) ordered notice to be given that no seaman should wear a cloak, except on Sunday . . . and if he did, that it should be taken from him by the constables (lhe serra tomada polos meirinhos), and the man put in the picota in disgrace, for one day.

But p\u0101'\u012b was originally, it would seem, the fourth part of an anna, and in fact identical with pice (q.v.). It is the H. -- Mahr. p\u0101'\u012b, 'a quarter,' from Skt. pad, p\u0101dik\u0101 in that sense.\n [1866. -- \". . . his father has a one pie share in a small village which may yield him perhaps 24 rupees per annum.\" -- Confessions of an Orderly, 201.]\n", "piece - goods": ". This, which is now the technical term for Manchester cottons imported into India, was originally applied in trade to the Indian cottons exported to England, a trade which appears to have been deliberately killed by the heavy duties which Lancashire procured to be imposed in its own interest, as in its own interest it has recently procured the abolition of the small import duty on English piece-goods in India.* [In 1898 a duty at the rate of 3 per cent. on cotton goods was reimposed.]\n It is an easy assumption that this export trade from India was killed by the development of machinery in England. We can hardly doubt that this cause would have killed it in time. But it was not left to any such lingering and natural death. Much time would be required to trace the whole of this episode of \"ancient history.\" But it is certain that this Indian trade was not killed by natural causes: it was killed by prohibitory duties. These duties were so high in 1783 that they were declared to operate as a premium on smuggling, and they were reduced to 18 per cent. ad valorem. In the year 1796-97 the value of piece-goods from India imported into England was \u00a32,776,682, or one-third of the whole value of the imports from India, which was \u00a38,252,309. And in the sixteen years between 1793-4 and 1809-10 (inclusive) the imports of Indian piece-goods amounted in value to \u00a326,171,125.\n In 1799 the duties were raised. I need not give details, but will come down to 1814, just before the close of the war, when they were, I believe, at a maximum. The duties then, on \"plain white calicoes,\" were:-\n  \u00a3 s. d Warehouse duty . . 4 0 0 per cent. War enhancement. . 1 0 0 \" Customs duty . . 50 0 0 \" War enhancement. . 12 10 0 \" --------  Total . . . 67 10 0{per cent. {on value.\n There was an Excise duty upon British manufactured and printed goods of 3\u00bdd. per square yard, and of twice that amount on foreign (Indian) calico and muslin printed in Great Britain, and the whole of both duty and excise upon such goods was recoverable as drawback upon re-exportation. But on the exportation of Indian white goods there was no drawback recoverable; and stuffs printed in India were at this time, so far as we can discern, not admitted through the English Custom - house at all until 1826, when they were admitted on a duty of 3\u00bdd. per square yard.\n (See in the Statutes, 43 Geo. III. capp. 68, 69, 70; 54 Geo. III. cap. 36; 6 Geo. IV. cap. 3; also Macpherson's Annals of Commerce, iv. 426).\n In Sir A. Arbuthnot's publication of Sir T. Munro's Minutes (Memoir, p. cxxix.) he quotes a letter of Munro's to a friend in Scotland, written about 1825, which shows him surprisingly before his age in the matter of Free Trade, speaking with reference to certain measures of Mr. Huskisson's. The passage ends thus: \"India is the country that has been worst used in the new arrangements. All her products ought undoubtedly to be imported freely into England, upon paying the same duties, and no more, which English duties [? manufactures] pay in India. When I see what is done in Parliament against India, I think that I am reading about Edward III. and the Flemings.\"\n Sir A. Arbuthnot adds very appropriately a passage from a note by the late Prof. H. H. Wilson in his continuation of James Mill's History of India (1845, vol. i. pp. 538-539), a passage which we also gladly insert here:\n \"It was stated in evidence (in 1813) that the cotton and silk goods of India, up to this period, could be sold for a profit in the British market at a price from 50 to 60 per cent. lower than those fabricated in England. It consequently became necessary to protect the latter by duties of 70 or 80 per cent. on their value, or by positive prohibition. Had this not been the case, had not such prohibitory duties and decrees existed, the mills of Paisley and of Manchester would have been stopped in their outset, and could hardly have been again set in motion, even by the powers of steam. They were created by the sacrifice of the Indian manufactures. Had India been independent, she would have retaliated; would have imposed preventive duties upon British goods, and would thus have preserved her own productive industry from annihilation. This act of self-defence was not permitted her; she was at the mercy of the stranger. British goods were forced upon her without paying any duty; and the foreign manufacturer employed the arm of political injustice to keep down and ultimately strangle a competitor with whom he could not contend on equal terms.\"\n Lists of the various kinds of Indian piece-goods will be found in Milburn (i. 44, 45, 46, and ii. 90, 221), and we assemble them below. It is not in our power to explain their peculiarities, except in very few cases, found under their proper heading. [In the present edition these lists have been arranged in alphabetical order. The figures before each indicate that they fall into the following classes: 1. Piece-goods formerly exported from Bombay and Surat; 2. Piece-goods exported from Madras and the Coast; 3. Piecegoods: the kinds imported into Great Britain from Bengal. Some notes and quotations have been added. But it must be understood that the classes of goods now known under these names may or may not exactly represent those made at the time when these lists were prepared. The names printed in capitals are discussed in separate articles.]\n 1665. -- \"I have sometimes stood amazed at the vast quantity of Cotton-Cloth of all sorts, fine and others, tinged and white, which the Hollanders alone draw from thence and transport into many places, especially into Japan and Europe; not to mention what the English, Portingal and Indian merchants carry away from those parts.\" -- Bernier, E.T. 141; [ed.

But Roquefort (s.v.) gives: \"Bure, Burel, grosse \u00e9toffe en laine de couleur rousse ou grisa\u0302tre, dont s'habillent ordinairement les ramoneurs; cette \u00e9toffe est faite de brebis noire et brune, sans aucune autre teinture.\" And see N.E.D. s.v.

The same name is now applied to a silk cloth. \"The word ch\u0101rkh\u0101na simply means a check,' but the term is applied to certain silk or mixed fabrics containing small checks, usually about 8 or 10 checks in a line to an inch.\" (Yusuf Ali, Mon. on Silk, 93.

In a list of cotton cloths in the \u0100\u012bn (i. 94) we have chaut\u0101r, which may mean 'made with four threads or wires.' Chaut\u0101h\u012b, 'four-fold,' is a kind of cloth used in the Punjab for counterpanes (Francis, Man. Cotton, 7).

In the \u0100\u012bn we have kh\u0101\u00e7ah in the list of cotton cloths (i. 94). Mr. Taylor describes it as a muslin of a close fine texture, and identifies it with the fine muslin which, according to the \u0100\u012bn (ii. 124), was produced at Son\u0101rg\u0101on.

In the list in the \u0100\u012bn (i. 95), Doriyah appears among cotton stuffs. It is now also made in silk: \"The simplest pattern is the stripe; when the stripes are longitudinal the fabric is a doriya. . . .

H\u0101ch\u0101, 'a kind of cloth woven of silk and thread so as to present the appearance of cardamoms (il\u0101ch\u012b).' But it is almost certainly identical with alleja. It was probably introduced to Agra, where now alone it is made, by the Moghuls. It differs from doriya (see DOREAS above) in having a substantial texture, whereas the doriya is generally flimsy.

Humhums, from Ar. \u1e25amm\u0101in, 'a Turkish bath' \"(apparently so named from its having been originally used at the bath), is a cloth of a thick stout texture, and generally worn as a wrapper in the cold season.\" (Taylor, op. cit. 63.)\n 2. Izarees. -- P. iz\u0101r, 'drawers, trousers.' Watson (op. cit. 57, note) says that in some places it is peculiar to men, the women's drawers being Turwar. Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam, App. xiv.) gives eezar as equivalent to shulwaur, like the pyjamma, but not so wide.\n 3. Jamdannies. -- P.-H. j\u0101md\u0101n\u012b, which is said to be properly j\u0101mahd\u0101n\u012b, 'a box for holding a suit.' The j\u0101md\u0101n\u012b is a loom-figured muslin, which Taylor (op. cit. 48) calls \"the most expensive productions of the Dacca looms.\"\n 3. Jamwars. H. j\u0101maw\u0101r, 'sufficient for a dress.' It is not easy to say what stuff is intended by this name. In the \u0100\u012bn (ii. 240) we have jamahw\u0101r, mentioned among Guzerat stuffs worked in gold thread, and again (i. 95) j\u0101mahw\u0101r Parmnarm among woollen stuffs. Forbes Watson gives among Kashm\u012br shawls: \"Jamewars, or striped shawl pieces\"; in the Punjab they are of a striped pattern made both in pashm and wool (Johnstone, Mon. on Wool, 9), and Mr. Kipling says, \"the stripes are broad, of alternate colours, red and blue, &c.\" (Mukharji, Art Manufactures of India, 374.)\n 3.

This is Anglo-Indian hog-hunting, or what would be called among a people delighting more in lofty expression, 'the chase of the Wild Boar.' When, very many years since, one of the present writers, destined for the Bengal Presidency, first made acquaintance with an Indian mess-table, it was that of a Bombay regiment at Aden -- in fact of that gallant corps which is now known as the 103rd Foot, or Royal Bombay Fusiliers. Hospitable as they were, the opportunity of enlightening an aspirant Bengalee on the short-comings of his Presidency could not be foregone. The chief counts of indictment were three: 1st. The inferiority of the Bengal Horse Artillery system; 2nd. That the Bengalees were guilty of the base effeminacy of drinking beer out of champagne glasses; 3rd. That in pig-sticking they threw the spear at the boar. The two last charges were evidently ancient traditions, maintaining their ground as facts down to 1840 therefore; and showed how little communication practically existed between the Presidencies as late as that year. Both the allegations had long ceased to be true, but probably the second had been true in the 18th century, as the third certainly had been. This may be seen from the quotation from R. Lindsay, and by the text and illustrations of Williamson's Oriental Field Sports (1807), [and much later (see below)]. There is, or perhaps we should say more diffidently there was, still a difference between the Bengal practice in pig-sticking, and that of Bombay. The Bengal spear is about 6\u00bd feet long, loaded with lead at the butt so that it can be grasped almost quite at the end and carried with the point down, inclining only slightly to the front; the boar's charge is received on the right flank, when the point, raised to 45\u02da or 50\u02da of inclination, if rightly guided, pierces him in the shoulder. The Bombay spear is a longer weapon, and is carried under the armpit like a dragoon's lance. Judging from Elphinstone's statement below we should suppose that the Bombay as well as the Bengal practice originally was to throw the spear, but that both independently discarded this, the Qui-his adopting the short overhand spear, the Ducks the long lance.\n 1679. -- \"In the morning we went a hunting of wild Hoggs with Kisna Reddy, the chief man of the Islands\" (at mouth of the Kistna) \"and about 100 other men of the island (Dio) with lances and Three score doggs, with whom we killed eight Hoggs great and small, one being a Bore very large and fatt, of greate weight.\" -- Consn. of Agent and Council of Fort St. Geo. on Tour.

R. Lindsay does speak of the \"Wild-boar chase\"; but he wrote after 35 years in England, and rather eschews Anglo-Indianisms:\n \"Our weapon consisted only of a short heavy spear, three feet in length, and well poised; the boar being found and unkennelled by the spaniels, runs with great speed across the plain, is pursued on horse-back, and the first rider who approaches him throws the javelin. . . .\" -- Lives of the Lindsays, iii. 161.\n 1807. -- \"When (the hog) begins to slacken, the attack should be commenced by the horseman who may be nearest pushing on to his left side; into which the spear should be thrown, so as to lodge behind the shoulder blade, and about six inches from the backbone.\" -- Williamson, Oriental Field Sports, p. 9.

This term is often applied to the Chinaman's long plait of hair, by transfer from the queue of our grandfathers, to which the name was much more appropriate. Though now universal among the Chinese, this fashion was only introduced by their Manchu conquerors in the 17th century, and was \"long resisted by the natives of the Amoy and Swatow districts, who, when finally compelled to adopt the distasteful fashion, concealed the badge of slavery beneath cotton turbans, the use of which has survived to the present day\" (Giles, Glossary of Reference, 32). Previously the Chinese wore their unshaven back hair gathered in a net, or knotted in a chignon. De Rhodes (Rome, 1615, p. 5) says of the people of Tongking, that \"like the Chinese they have the custom of gathering the hair in fine nets under the hat.\"\n 1879. -- \"One sees a single Sikh driving four or five Chinamen in front of him, having knotted their pigtails together for reins.\" -- Miss Bird, Golden Chersonese, 283.\n", "pilau": "&c., s.

Hind. pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012b, pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u0101, but of which the more original form appears to be Mahr. pen\u1e0dh\u0101r\u012b, a member of a band of plunderers called in that language pen\u1e0dh\u0101r and pen\u1e0dh\u0101r\u0101. The etymology of the word is very obscure. We may discard as a curious coincidence only, the circumstance observed by Mr. H. T. Prinsep, in the work quoted below (i. 37, note), that \"Pindara seems to have the same reference to Pandour that Kuz\u0101k has to Cossack.\" Sir John Malcolm observes that the most popular etymology among the natives ascribes the name to the dissolute habits of the class, leading them to frequent the shops dealing in an intoxicating drink called pinda. (One of the senses of pen\u1e0dh\u0101, according to Molesworth's Mahr. Dict., is 'a drink for cattle and men, prepared from Holcus sorghum' (see JOWAUR) 'by steeping it and causing it to ferment. ') Sir John adds: 'Kurreem Khan' (a famous Pindarry leader) 'told me he had never heard of any other reason for the name; and Major Henley had the etymology confirmed by the most intelligent of the Pindarries of whom he enquired' (Central India, 2nd ed. i. 433). Wilson again considers the most probable derivation to be from the Mahr. pen\u1e0dh\u0101, but in the sense of a 'bundle of rice-straw,' and hara, 'who takes,' because the name was originally applied to horsemen who hung on to an army, and were employed in collecting forage. We cannot think either of the etymologies very satisfactory. We venture another, as a plausible suggestion merely. Both pin\u1e0d-pa\u1e5bn\u0101 in Hindi, and pin\u1e0d\u0101s-basne\u1e45 in Mahr. signify 'to follow'; the latter being defined 'to stick closely to; to follow to the death; used of the adherence of a disagreeable fellow.' Such phrases would aptly apply to these hangers-on of an army in the field, looking out for prey. [The question has been discussed by Mr. W. Irvine in an elaborate note published in the Indian Antiq. of 1900. To the above three suggestions he adds two made by other authorities: 4. that the term was taken from the Beder race; 5. from Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u0101, pin\u1e0d, 'a lump of food,' \u0101r, 'bringer,' a plunderer. As to the fourth suggestion, he remarks that there was a Beder race dwelling in Mysore, Belary and the Nizam's territories. But the objection to this etymology is that as far back as 1748 both words, Bedar and Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012b, are used by the native historian, R\u0101m Singh Munsh\u012b, side by side, but applied to different bodies of men. Mr. Irvine's suggestion is that the word Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012b, or more strictly Pan\u1e0dh\u0101r, comes from a place or region called P\u0101ndh\u0101r or Pandh\u0101r. This place is referred to by native historians, and seems to have been situated between Burh\u0101npur and Handiya on the Nerbudda. There is good evidence to prove that large numbers of Pind\u0101ris were settled in this part of the country. Mr. Irvine sums up by saying: \"If it were not for a passage in Grant Duff (H. of the Mahrattas, Bombay reprint, 157), I should have been ready to maintain that I had proved my case. My argument requires two things to make it irrefutable: (1) a very early connection between Pandh\u0101r and the Pindh\u0101ris; (2) that the Pindh\u0101ris had no early home or settlement outside Pandh\u0101r. As to the first point, the recorded evidence seems to go no further back than 1794, when Sendhiah granted them lands in Nim\u0101r; whereas before that time the name had become fixed, and had even crept into Anglo-Indian vocabularies. As to the second point, Grant Duff says, and he if anybody must have known, that \"there were a number of Pindh\u0101ris about the borders of Mah\u0101r\u0101shtra and the Carnatic. . . .\" Unless these men emigrated from Khandesh about 1726 (that is a hundred years before 1826, the date of Grant Duff's book), their presence in the South with the same name tends to disprove any special connection between their name, Pindh\u0101ri, and a place, Pindh\u0101r, several hundred miles from their country. On the other hand, it is a very singular coincidence that men known as Pindh\u0101ris should have been newly settled about 1794 in a country which had been known as Pandh\u0101r at least ninety years before they thus occupied it. Such a mere fortuitous connection between Pandh\u0101r and the Pindh\u0101ris is so extraordinary that we may call it an impossibility. A fair inference is that the region Pandh\u0101r was the original home of the Pindh\u0101ris, that they took their name from it, and that grants of land between Burh\u0101npur and Handiya were made to them in what had always been their home-country, namely Pandh\u0101r.\"]\n The Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012bs seem to have grown up in the wars of the late Mahommedan dynasties in the Deccan, and in the latter part of the 17th century attached themselves to the Mahrattas in their revolt against Aurangz\u012bb; the first mention which we have seen of the name occurs at this time. For some particulars regarding them we refer to the extract from Prinsep below. During and after the Mahratta wars of Lord Wellesley's time many of the Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012b leaders obtained grants of land in Central India from Sindia and Holkar, and in the chaos which reigned at that time outside the British territory their raids in all directions, attended by the most savage atrocities, became more and more intolerable; these outrages extended from Bundelkhand on the N.E., Kadapa on the S., and Orissa on the S.E., to Guzerat on the W., and at last repeatedly violated British territory. In a raid made upon the coast extending from Masulipatam northward, the Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012bs in ten days plundered 339 villages, burning many, killing and wounding 682 persons, torturing 3600, and carrying off or destroying property to the amount of \u00a3250,000. It was not, however, till 1817 that the Governor - General, the Marquis of Hastings, found himself armed with permission from home, and in a position to strike at them effectually, and with the most extensive strategic combinations ever brought into action in India. The Pin\u1e0d\u0101r\u012bs were completely crushed, and those of the native princes who supported them compelled to submit, whilst the British power for the first time was rendered truly paramount throughout India.\n 1706-7. -- \"Zoolfecar Khan, after the rains pursued Dhunnah, who fled to the Beejapore country, and the Khan followed him to the banks of the Kistnah.

Books distinguish between the Musa sapientum or plantain, and the Musa paradisaica or banana; but it is hard to understand where the line is supposed to be drawn. Variation is gradual and infinite.\n The botanical name Musa represents the Ar. mauz, and that again is from the Skt. mocha. The specific name sapientum arises out of a misunderstanding of a passage in Pliny, which we have explained under the head Jack. The specific paradisaica is derived from the old belief of Oriental Christians (entertained also, if not originated by the Mahommedans) that this was the tree from whose leaves Adam and Eve made themselves aprons. A further mystical interest attached also to the fruit, which some believed to be the forbidden apple of Eden. For in the pattern formed by the core or seeds, when the fruit was cut across, our forefathers discerned an image of the Cross, or even of the Crucifix. Medieval travellers generally call the fruit either Musa or 'Fig of Paradise,' or sometimes 'Fig of India,' and to this day in the W. Indies the common small plantains are called 'figs.' The Portuguese also habitually called it 'Indian Fig.' And this perhaps originated some confusion in Milton's mind, leading him to make the Banyan (Ficus Indica of Pliny, as of modern botanists) the Tree of the aprons, and greatly to exaggerate the size of the leaves of that ficus.\n The name banana is never employed by the English in India, though it is the name universal in the London fruit-shops, where this fruit is now to be had at almost all seasons, and often of excellent quality, imported chiefly, we believe, from Madeira, [and more recently from Jamaica. Mr. Skeat adds that in the Strait Settlements the name plantain seems to be reserved for those varieties which are only eatable when cooked, but the word banana is used indifferently with plantain, the latter being on the whole perhaps the rarer word].\n The name plantain is no more originally Indian than is banana. It, or rather platano, appears to have been the name under which the fruit was first carried to the W. Indies, according to Oviedo, in 1516; the first edition of his book was published in 1526. That author is careful to explain that the plant was improperly so called, as it was quite another thing from the platanus described by Pliny. Bluteau says the word is Spanish. We do not know how it came to be applied to the Musa. [Mr. Guppy (8 ser. Notes & Queries, viii. 87) suggests that \"the Spaniards have obtained platano from the Carib and Galibi words for banana, viz., balatanna and palatana, by the process followed by the Australian colonists when they converted a native name for the casuarina trees into 'she-oak'; and that we can thus explain how platano came in Spanish to signify both the plane-tree and the banana\" Prof. Skeat (Concise Dict. s.v.) derives plantain from Lat. planta, 'a plant'; properly 'a spreading sucker or shoot'; and says that the plantain took its name from its spreading leaf.] The rapid spread of the plantain or banana in the West, whence both names were carried back to India, is a counterpart to the rapid diffusion of the ananas in the Old World of Asia. It would seem from the translation of Mendo\u00e7a that in his time (1585) the Spaniards had come to use the form plantano, which our Englishmen took up as plantan and plantain. But even in the 1736 edition of Bailey's Dict. the only explanation of plantain given is as the equivalent of the Latin plantago, the field-weed known by the former name. Platano and Plantano are used in the Philippine Islands by the Spanish population.\n 1336. -- \"Sunt in Syria\u0302 et Aegypto poma oblonga quae Paradisi nuncupantur optimi saporis, mollia, in ore cito dissolubilia: per transversum quotiescumque ipsa incideris invenies Crucifixum . . . diu non durant, unde per mare ad nostras partes duci non possunt incorrupta.\" -- Gul. de Boldensele.\n c. 1350. -- \"Sunt enim in orto illo Adae de Seyllano primo musae, quas incolae ficus vocant . . . et istud vidimus oculis nostris quod ubicunque inciditur per transversum, in utra\u0302que parte incisurae videtur ymago hominis crucifixi . . . et de istis foliis fic\u00fbs Adam et Eva fecerunt sibi perizomata. . . .\" -- John de' Marignolli, in Cathay, &c. p. 352.\n 1384. -- \"And there is again a fruit which many people assert to be that regarding which our first father Adam sinned, and this fruit they call Muse . . . in this fruit you see a very great miracle, for when you divide it anyway, whether lengthways or across, or cut it as you will, you shall see inside, as it were, the image of the Crucifix; and of this we comrades many times made proof.\" -- Viaggio di Simone Sigoli (Firenze, 1862, p. 160).\n 1526 (tr. 1577). -- \"There are also certayne plantes whiche the Christians call Platani.

The game of hockey on horseback, introduced of late years into England, under this name, which comes from Balt\u012b; polo being properly in the language of that region the ball used in the game. The game thus lately revived was once known and practised (though in various forms) from Provence to the borders of China (see CHICANE). It had continued to exist down to our own day, it would seem, only near the extreme East and the extreme West of the Him\u0101laya, viz. at Manipur in the East (between Cachar and Burma), and on the West in the high valley of the Indus (in Lad\u0101k, Balti, Asto\u0304r and Gilgit, and extending into Chitr\u0101l). From the former it was first adopted by our countrymen at Calcutta, and a little later (about 1864) it was introduced into the Punjab, almost simultaneously from the Lower Provinces and from Kashm\u012br, where the summer visitors had taken it up. It was first played in England, it would seem at Aldershot, in July 1871, and in August of the same year at Dublin in the Ph\u0153nix Park. The next year it was played in many places.* But the first mention we can find in the Times is a notice of a match at Lillie-Bridge, July 11, 1874, in the next day's paper. There is mention of the game in the Illustrated London News of July 20, 1872, where it is treated as a new invention by British officers in India. [According to the author of the Badminton Library treatise on the game, it was adopted by Lieut. Sherer in 1854, and a club was formed in 1859. The same writer fixes its introduction into the Punjab and N.W.P. in 1861 62. See also an article in Baily's Magazine on \"The Early History of Polo.\" (June 1890). The Central Asian form is described, under the name of Baiga or Kok-b\u00fcra, 'grey wolf,' by Schuyler (Turkistan, i. 268 seqq.) and that in Dardistan by Biddulph (Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh, 84 seqq.).] In Lad\u0101k it is not indigenous, but an introduction from Baltistan. See a careful and interesting account of the game of those parts in Mr. F. Drew's excellent book, The Jummoo and Kashmir Territories, 1875, pp. 380-392.\n We learn from Professor Tylor that the game exists still in Japan, and a very curious circumstance is that the polo racket, just as that described by See details in the Field of Nov. 15, 1884, p. 667, courteously given in reply to a query from the present writer.\n Jo. Cinnamus in the extract under CHICANE has survived there.

The French of Pondicherry call the fish pample. We cannot connect it with the POMPI/LOS of Aelian (xv. 23) and Athenaeus (Lib. VII. cap. xviii. seqq.) which is identified with a very different fish, the 'pilot-fish' (Naucrates ductor of Day). The name is probably from the Portuguese, and a corruption of pampano, 'a vine-leaf,' from supposed resemblance; this is the Portuguese name of a fish which occurs just where the pomfret should be mentioned.

Citrus decumana, L., the largest of the orange-tribe. It is the same fruit as the shaddock of the West Indies; but to the larger varieties some form of the name Pommelo seems also to be applied in the West. A small variety, with a fine skin, is sold in London shops as \"the Forbidden fruit.\" The fruit, though grown in gardens over a great part of India, really comes to perfection only near the Equator, and especially in Java, whence it was probably brought to the continent. For it is called in Bengal Bat\u0101v\u012b nimb\u016b (i.e. Citrus Bataviana). It probably did not come to India till the 17th century; it is not mentioned in the \u0100\u012bn. According to Bretschneider the Pommelo is mentioned in the ancient Chinese Book of the Shu-King. Its Chinese name is Yu.\n The form of the name which we have put first is that now general in Anglo-Indian use. But it is probably only a modern result of 'striving after meaning' (quasi Pomo-melone?). Among older authors the name goes through many strange shapes. Tavernier calls it pompone (Voy. des Indes, liv. iii. ch. 24; [ed. Ball, ii. 360]), but the usual French name is pampel-mousse. Dampier has Pumplenose (ii. 125); Lockyer, Pumplemuse (51); Forrest, Pummel-nose (32); Ives, 'pimple-noses, called in the West Indies Chadocks' [19]. Maria Graham uses the French spelling (22). Pompoleon is a form unknown to us, but given in the Eng. Cyclopaedia. Molesworth's Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi Dict. gives \"papannas, papanas, or papanis (a word of S. America).\" We are unable to give the true etymology, though Littr\u00e9 says boldly \"Tamoul, bambolimas.\" Ainslie (Mat. Medica, 1813) gives Poomlimas as the Tamil, whilst Balfour (Cycl. of India) gives Pumpalimas and Bambulimas as Tamil, Bombarimasa and Pampara-panasa as Telugu, Bambali naringi as Malay\u0101lim. But if these are real words they appear to be corruptions of some foreign term. [Mr. F. Brandt points out that the above forms are merely various attempts to transliterate a word which is in Tamil pambalim\u0101su, while the Malay\u0101lim is bamb\u0101li - n\u0101rakam 'bambili tree.' According to the Madras Gloss. all these, as well as the English forms, are ultimately derived from the Malay pumpulmas. Mr. Skeat writes: \"In an obsolete Malay dict., by Howison (1801) I find 'poomplemoos, a fruit brought from India by Captain Shaddock, the seeds of which were planted at Barbadoes,' and afterwards obtained his name: the affix moos appears to be the Dutch moes, 'vegetable.'\" If this be so, the Malay is not the original form.]\n 1661. -- \"The fruit called by the Netherlanders Pumpelmoos, by the Portuguese Jamboa, grows in superfluity outside the city of Batavia. . . . This fruit is larger than any of the lemon - kind, for it grows as large as the head of a child of 10 years old. The core or inside is for the most part reddish, and has a kind of sourish sweetness, tasting like unripe grapes.\" -- Walter Schulzen, 236\n", "pondicherry": "n.p. This name of what is now the chief French settlement in India, is Pudu-ch'ch\u0113ri, or Puthu\u00e7\u00e7\u0113ri, 'New Town,' more correctly Pudu-vai, Puthuvai, meaning 'New Place.' C. P. Brown, however, says it is Pudi-cher\u016b, 'New Tank.' The natives sometimes write it Phulcheri.  [Mr. Garstin (Man. S. Arcot, 422) says that Hindus call it Puthuvai or Puthu\u00e7\u00e7eri, while Musulmans call it Pulcheri, or as the Madras Gloss. writes the word, Pulchari.]\n 1680. -- \"Mr. Edward Brogden, arrived from Porto Novo, reports arrival at Puddicherry of two French ships from Surat, and the receipt of advices of the death of Sevajie.\" -- Fort St. Geo.

The history of this word for China-ware appears to be as follows. The family of univalve mollusks called Cypraeidae, or Cowries, (q.v.) were in medieval Italy called porcellana and porcelletta, almost certainly from their strong resemblance to the body and back of a pig, and not from a grosser analogy suggested by Mahn (see in Littr\u00e9 sub voce). That this is so is strongly corroborated by the circumstance noted by Dr. J. E. Gray (see Eng. Cyc. Nat. Hist. s.v. Cypraeidae) that Pig is the common name of shells of this family on the English coast; whilst Sow also seems to be a name of one or more kinds. The enamel of this shell seems to have been used in the Middle Ages to form a coating for ornamental pottery, &c., whence the early application of the term porcellana to the fine ware brought from the far East. Both applications of the term, viz. to cowries and to China-ware, occur in Marco Polo (see below). The quasi-analogous application of pig in Scotland to earthen-ware, noticed in an imaginary quotation below, is probably quite an accident, for there appears to be a Gaelic pige, 'an earthen jar,' &c. (see Skeat, s.v. piggin). We should not fail to recall Dr. Johnson's etymology of porcelaine from \"pour cent ann\u00e9es,\" because it was believed by Europeans that the materials were matured under ground 100 years!

We know this word only from its occurrence in the passage quoted; and most probably the explanation suggested by the editor of the Notes is correct, viz. that it represents Port. peragua.

Yule has the following note: \"J. (i.e. T.) B., the author, gives a rough drawing. It represents the Purgoe as a somewhat high-sterned lighter, not very large, with five oarpins a side. I cannot identify it exactly with any kind of modern boat of which I have found a representation. It is perhaps most like the palw\u0101r.

There seems to be no such word known there now. I think, however, that the term Purgoo is probably an obsolete Anglo-Indian corruption of an Indian corruption of the Port. term barco, barca, a term used for any kind of sailing boat by the early Portuguese visitors to the East (e.g. D'Alboquerque, Hak.

This is a term constantly used in Burma, familiar to all who have been in that country, in its constant application as a style of respect, addressed or applied to persons and things of especial sanctity or dignity. Thus it is addressed at Court to the King; it is the habitual designation of the Buddha and his images and dagobas; of superior ecclesiastics and sacred books; corresponding on the whole in use, pretty closely to the Skt. \u015a\u1e5b\u012b. In Burmese the word is written bhur\u0101, but pronounced (in Arakan) p'hr\u0101, and in modern Burma Proper, with the usual slurring of the r, P'hy\u0101 or Py\u0101. The use of the term is not confined to Burma; it is used in quite a similar way in Siam, as may be seen in the quotation below from Alabaster; the word is used in the same form P'hra among the Shans; and in the form Prea, it would seem, in Camboja. Thus Garnier speaks of Indra and Vishnu under their Cambojan epithets as Prea En and Prea Noreai (N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a); of the figure of Buddha entering nirv\u0101na, as Prea Nippan; of the King who built the great temple of Angkor Wat as Prea Kot Melea, of the King reigning at the time of the expedition as Prea Ang Reachea Vodey, of various sites of temples as Preacon, Preacan, Prea Pithu, &c. (Voyage d'Exploration, i. 26, 49, 388, 77, 85, 72).\n The word p'hr\u0101 appears in composition in various names of Burmese kings, as of the famous AlomP'hra (1753-60), founder of the late dynasty, and of his son Bodoah-p'hra (1781 1819). In the former instance the name is, according to Sir A. Phayre, Alaung-p'hr\u0101, i.e. the embryo Buddha, or Bodisatva. A familiar Siamese example of use is in the Phr\u0101 B\u0101t, or sacred foot-mark of Buddha, a term which represents the \u015a\u1e5bi Pada of Ceylon.\n The late Prof. H. H. Wilson, as will be seen, supposed the word to be a corruption of Skt. prabhu (see PARVOE). But Mr. Alabaster points, under the guidance of the Siamese spelling, rather to Skt. vara, 'pre-eminent, excellent.' This is in Pali varo, \"excellent, best, precious, noble\" (Childers). A curious point is that, from the prevalence of the term phr\u0101 in all the Indo-Chinese kingdoms, we must conclude that it was, at the time of the introduction of Buddhism into those countries, in predominant use among the Indian or Ceylonese propagators of the new religion. Yet we do not find any evidence of such a use of either prabhu or vara. The former would in Pali be pabbho. In a short paper in the Bijdragen of the Royal Institute of the Hague (Dl. X. 4de Stuk, 1885), Prof. Kern indicates that this term was also in use in Java, in the forms Bra and pra, with the sense of 'splendid' and the like; and he cites as an example Bra-Wijaya (the style of several of the medieval kings of Java), where Bra is exactly the representative of Skt. \u015a\u1e5b\u012b.\n 1688. -- \"I know that in the country of Laos the Dignities of Pa-ya and Meuang, and the honourable Epithets of Pra are in use; it may be also that the other terms of Dignity are common to both Nations, as well as the Laws.\" -- De la Loub\u00e8re, Siam, E.T. 79.\n \" \"The Pra-Clang, or by a corruption of the Portugueses, the Barcalon, is the officer, who has the appointment of the Commerce, as well within as without the Kingdom. . . .

On the word in question, Professor H. H. Wilson has kindly favoured me with a note: 'Phr\u00e1 is no doubt a corruption of the Sanskrit Prabhu, a Lord or Master; the h of the aspirate bh is often retained alone, leaving Prahu which becomes Pr\u00e1h or Phra.'\" -- Sir H.

In 1704-5, we read that he reported favourably on the prospects of the settlement, requesting a supply of young writers, to learn the Chinese language, anticipating that the island would soon become an important station for Chinese trade. But Catchpole was himself, about the end of 1705, murdered by certain people of Macassar, who thought he had broken faith with them, and with him all the English but two (see Bruce's Annals, 483-4, 580, 606, and A.

Indies, of the Opuntia Dillenii, Haworth (Cactus Indica, Roxb.), a plant spread all over India, and to which Roxburgh gave the latter name, apparently in the belief of its being indigenous in that country. Undoubtedly, however, it came from America, wide as has been its spread over Southern Europe and Asia. On some parts of the Mediterranean shores (e.g. in Sicily) it has become so characteristic that it is hard to realize the fact that the plant had no existence there before the 16th century. Indeed at Palermo we have heard this scouted, and evidence quoted in the supposed circumstance that among the mosaics of the splendid Duomo of Monreale (12th century) the fig-leaf garments of Adam and Eve are represented as of this uncompromising material. The mosaic was examined by one of the present writers, with the impression that the belief has no good foundation. [See 8th ser. Notes and Queries, viii. 254.] The cactus fruit, yellow, purple, and red, which may be said to form an important article of diet in the Mediterranean, and which is now sometimes seen in London shops, is not, as far as we know, anywhere used in India, except in times of famine. No cactus is named in Drury's Useful Plants of India. And whether the Mediterranean plants form a different species, or varieties merely, as compared with the Indian Opuntia, is a matter for inquiry. The fruit of the Indian plant is smaller and less succulent. There is a good description of the plant and fruit in Oviedo, with a good cut (see Ramusio's Ital. version, bk. viii. ch. xxv.). That author gives an amusing story of his first making acquaintance with the fruit in S. Domingo, in the year 1515.\n Some of the names by which the Opuntia is known in the Punjab seem to belong properly to species of Euphorbia. Thus the EuphorbiaRoyleana, Bois., is called ts\u016b\u012b, ch\u016b, &c.; and the Opuntia is called K\u0101bul\u012b ts\u016b\u012b, Gangi sho, Kanghi ch\u016b, &c. Gangi ch\u016b is also the name of an Euphorbia sp. which Dr. Stewart takes to be the E. Neriifolia, L. (Punjab Plants, pp. 101 and 194-5). [The common name in Upper India for the prickly pear is n\u0101gphan\u012b, 'snake-hood,' from its shape.] This is curious; for although certain cactuses are very like certain Euphorbias, there is no Euphorbia resembling the Opuntia in form.\n The Za\u1e33\u016bm mentioned in the \u0100\u012bn (Gladwin, 1800, ii. 68; [Jarrett, ii. 239; Sidi Ali, ed. Vambery, p. 31] as used for hedges in Guzerat, is doubtless Euphorbia also. The Opuntia is very common as a hedge plant in cantonments, &c., and it was much used by Tippoo as an obstruction round his fortifications. Both the E. Royleana and the Opuntia are used for fences in parts of the Punjab. The latter is objectionable, from harbouring dirt and reptiles; but it spreads rapidly both from birds eating the fruit, and from the facility with which the joints take root.\n 1685. -- \"The Prickly-Pear, Bush, or Shrub, of about 4 or 5 foot high . . . the Fruit at first is green, like the Leaf. . . .

This beverage, according to the received etymology, was named from the Pers. panj, or Hind. and Mahr. p\u0101nch, both meaning 'five'; because composed of five ingredients, viz. arrack, sugar, lime-juice, spice, and water. Fryer may be considered to give something like historical evidence of its origin; but there is also something of Indian idiom in the suggestion. Thus a famous horsemedicine in Upper India is known as batt\u012bs\u012b, because it is supposed to contain 32 ('batt\u012bs') ingredients. Schiller, in his Punschlied, sacrificing truth to trope, omits the spice and makes the ingredients only 4: \"Vier Elemente Innig gesellt, Bilden das Leben, Bauen die Welt.\"\n The Greeks also had a \"Punch,\" PENTAPLO/A, as is shown in the quotation from Athenaeus.

And this combination in the form of Bole-ponjis was adopted as the title of a Miscellany published in 1851, by H. Meredith Parker, a Bengal civilian, of local repute for his literary and dramatic tastes. He had lost sight of the original authorities for the term, and his quotation is far astray. We give them correctly below.\n c. 210. -- \"On the feast of the Scirrha at Athens he (Aristodemus on Pindar) says a race was run by the young men.

The office became extinct on the constitution of the 'High Court,' superseding the Supreme Court and Sudder Court, under the Queen's Letters Patent of May 14, 1862.\n In the Mahratta and Telegu countries, the word Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit is usually pronounced Pant (in English colloquial Punt); but in this form it has, as with many other Indian words in like case, lost its original significance, and become a mere personal title, familiar in Mahratta history, e.g. the N\u0101n\u0101 Dhundopant of evil fame.\n Within the last 30 or 35 years the term has acquired in India a peculiar application to the natives trained in the use of instruments, who have been employed beyond the British Indian frontier in surveying regions inaccessible to Europeans. This application originated in the fact that two of the earliest men to be so employed, the explorations by one of whom acquired great celebrity, were masters of village schools in our Him\u0101layan provinces. And the title Pundit is popularly employed there much as Dominie used to be in Scotland. The Pundit who brought so much fame on the title was the late Nain Singh, C.S.I.

The name of the country between the Indus and the Sutlej. The modern Anglo - Indian province so-called, now extends on one side up beyond the Indus, including Pesh\u0101war, the Deraj\u0101t, &c., and on the other side up to the Jumna, including Delhi. [In 1901 the Frontier Districts were placed under separate administration. ] The name is Pers. Panj-ab, 'Five Rivers.' These rivers, as reckoned, sometimes include the Indus, in which case the five are (1) Indus, (2) Jelam (see JELUM) or Behat, the ancient Vitasta which the Greeks made *(UDA/SPHS (Strabo) and *BIDA/SPHS (Ptol.), (3) Chen\u0101b, ancient Chandrab\u0101gha and \u0100sikn\u012b. Ptolemy preserves a corruption of the former Sanskrit name in *SANDABA/L, but it was rejected by the older Greeks because it was of ill omen, i.e. probably because Grecized it would be *CANDROFA/GOS, 'the devourer of Alexander.' The alternative \u0100sikn\u012b they rendered *)AKESI/NHS. (4) R\u0101v\u012b, the ancient Air\u0101vat\u012b, *(UA/RWTHS (Strabo), *UDRAW/THS (Arrian), *)/ADRIS or *(POU/ADIS (Ptol.). (5) Bi\u0101s, ancient Vip\u0101s\u0101, *(/UFASIS (Arrian), *BIBA/SIOS (Ptol.). This excluded the Sutlej, Satadru, Hesydrus of Pliny, *ZARA/DROS or *ZADA/DRHS (Ptol.), as Timur excludes it below. We may take in the Sutlej and exclude the Indus, but we can hardly exclude the Chen\u0101b as Wass\u0101f does below.\n No corresponding term is used by the Greek geographers. \"Putandum est nomen Panchanadae Graecos aut omnino latuisse, aut casu quodam non ad nostra usque tempora pervenisse, quod in tanta monumentorum ruina facile accidere potuit\" (Lassen,Pentapotamia, 3). Lassen however has termed the country Pentepotamia in a learned Latin dissertation on its ancient geography. Though the actual word Panj\u0101b is Persian, and dates from Mahommedan times, the corresponding Skt. Panchanada is ancient and genuine, occurring in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. The name Panj-\u0101b in older Mahommedan writers is applied to the Indus river, after receiving the rivers of the country which we call Punjaub. In that sense Panj-nad, of equivalent meaning, is still occasionally used. [In S. India the term is sometimes applied to the country watered by the Tumbhadra, Wardha, Malprabha, Gatprabha and Kistna (Wilks, Hist. Sketches, Madras reprint, i. 405).]\n We remember in the newspapers, after the second Sikh war, the report of a speech by a clergyman in England, who spoke of the deposition of \"the bloody Punjaub of Lahore.\"\n B.C. x. -- \"Having explored the land of the Pahlavi and the country adjoining, there had then to be searched Panchanada in every part; the monkeys then explore the region of Kashm\u012br with its woods of acacias.\" -- R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, Bk. iv. ch. 43.\n c. 940. -- Ma\u1e63'\u016bd\u012b details (with no correctness) the five rivers that form the Mihr\u0101n or Indus.

The quotation from Linschoten shows that some such apparatus was known in the 16th century, though this comes out clearly in the French version alone; the original Dutch, and the old English translation are here unintelligible, and indicate that Linschoten (who apparently never was at Ormuz) was describing, from hearsay, something that he did not understand.

This is the tradename for a fragrant root, a product of the Him\u0101laya in the vicinity of Kashm\u012br, and forming an article of export from both Bombay and Calcutta to the Malay countries and to China, where it is used as a chief ingredient of the Chinese pastille-rods commonly called jostick. This root was recognised by the famous Garcia de Orta as the Costus of the ancients. The latter took their word from the Skt. kus\u1e6dha, by a modification of which name -- ku\u1e6d -- it is still known and used as a medicine in Upper India. De Orta speaks of the plant as growing about Mandu and Chitore, whence it was brought for sale to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d; but his informants misled him. The true source was traced in situ by two other illustrious men, Royle and Falconer, to a plant belonging to the N. O. Compositae, Saussurea Xappe, Clarke, for which Dr. Falconer, not recognising the genus, had proposed the name of Aucklandia Costus verus, in honour of the then Governor-General. The Costus is a gregarious plant, occupying open, sloping sides of the mountains, at an elevation of 8000 to 9000 feet. See article by Falconer in Trans. Linn. Soc. xix. 23-31.\n The trade-name is, according to Wilson, the Telugu p\u0101ch'ch\u0101ku, 'green leaf,' but one does not see how this applies. (Is there, perhaps, some confusion with Patch? see PATCHOULI). De Orta speaks as if the word, which he writes pucho, were Malay. Though neither Crawfurd nor Favre gives the word, in this sense, it is in Marsden's earlier Malay Dict.: \"P\u016bchok, a plant, the aromatic leaves of which are an article of trade; said by some to be Costus indicus, and by others the Melissa, or Laurus.\" [On this Mr. Skeat writes: \"Puchok is the Malay word for a young sprout, or the growing shoot of a plant. Puchok in the special sense here used is also a Malay word, but it may be separate from the other. Klinkert gives puchok as a sprout or shoot and also as a radish-like root (indigenous in China (sic), used in medicine for fumigation, &c.). Apparently it is always the root and not the leaves of the plant that are used, in which case Marsden may have confused the two senses of the word.\"] In the year 1837-38 about 250 tons of this article, valued at \u00a310,000, were exported from Calcutta alone. The annual import into China at a later date, according to Wells Williams, was 2,000 peculs or 120 tons (Middle Kingdom, ed. 1857, ii. 308). In 1865 66, the last year for which the details of such minor exports are found in print, the quantity exported from Calcutta was only 492\u00bd cwt., or 24\u215d tons. In 1875 the value of the imports at Hankow and Chefoo was \u00a36,421. [Watt, Econ.
