{"cabaya": "s. This word, though of Asiatic origin, was perhaps introduced into India by the Portuguese, whose writers of the 16th century apply it to the surcoat or long tunic of muslin, which is one of the most common native garments of the better classes in India. The word seems to be one of those which the Portuguese had received in older times from the Arabic (\u1e33ab\u0101, 'a vesture'). From Dozy's remarks this would seem in Barbary to take the form \u1e33ab\u0101ya. Whether from Arabic or from Portuguese, the word has been introduced into the Malay countries, and is in common use in Java for the light cotton surcoat worn by Europeans, both ladies and gentlemen, in dishabille. The word is not now used in India Proper, unless by the Portuguese. But it has become familiar in Dutch, from its use in Java. [Mr. Gray, in his notes to Pyrard (i. 372), thinks that the word was introduced before the time of the Portuguese, and remarks that kabaya in Ceylon means a coat or jacket worn by a European or native.]\n c. 1540. -- \"There was in her an Embassador who had brought Hidalcan [Idalcan] a very rich Cabaya . . . which he would not accept of, for that thereby he would not acknowledge himself subject to the Turk.\" -- Cogan's Pinto, pp. 10-11.\n 1552. -- \". . . he ordered him then to bestow a cabaya.\" -- Castanheda, iv. 438.

This word is used in Anglo-Indian households generically for roast meat. [It usually follows the name of the dish, e.g. murgh\u012b kab\u0101b, 'roast fowl'.] But specifically it is applied to the dish described in the quotations from Fryer and Ovington.\n c. 1580. -- \"Altero modo . . . ipsam (carnem) in parva frustra dissectam, et veruculis ferreis acuum modo infixam, super crates ferreas igne supposito positam torrefaciunt, quam succo limonum aspersam avid\u00e8 esitant.\" -- Prosper Alpinus, Pt. i. 229.\n 1673. -- \"Cabob is Rostmeat on Skewers, cut in little round pieces no bigger than a Sixpence, and Ginger and Garlick put between each.\" -- Fryer, 404.\n 1689. -- \"Cabob, that is Beef or Mutton cut in small pieces, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and dipt with Oil and Garlick, which have been mixt together in a dish, and then roasted on a Spit, with sweet Herbs put between and stuff in them, and basted with Oil and Garlick all the while.\" -- Ovington, 397.\n 1814. -- \"I often partook with my Arabs of a dish common in Arabia called Kabob or Kab-ab, which is meat cut into small pieces and placed on thin skewers, alternately between slices of onion and green ginger, seasoned with pepper, salt, and Kian, fried in ghee, to be ate with rice and dholl.\" -- Forbes, Or.

This is the Ceylon term for the substance called in India Laterite (q.v.), and in Madras by the native name Moorum (q.v.). The word is perhaps the Port. cabouco or cavouco, 'a quarry.' It is not in Singh. Dictionaries. [Mr. Ferguson says that it is a corruption of the Port. pedras de cavouco, 'quarry-stones,' the last word being by a misapprehension applied to the stones themselves. The earliest instance of the use of the word he has met with occurs in the Travels of Dr. Aegidius Daalmans (1687-89), who describes kaphok stone as 'like small pebbles lying in a hard clay, so that if a large square stone is allowed to lie for some time in the water, the clay dissolves and the pebbles fall in a heap together; but if this stone is laid in good mortar, so that the water cannot get at it, it does good service' (J. As. Soc. Ceylon, x. 162). The word is not in the ordinary Singhalese Dicts., but A. Mendis Gunasekara in his Singhalese Grammar (1891), among words derived from the Port., gives kabuk-gal (cabouco), cabook (stone), 'laterite.']\n 1834. -- \"The soil varies in different situations on the Island. In the country round Colombo it consists of a strong red clay, or marl, called Cabook, mixed with sandy ferruginous particles.\" -- Ceylon Gazetteer, 33.\n \" \"The houses are built with cabook, and neatly whitewashed with chunam.\"- Ibid. 75.\n 1860. -- \"A peculiarity which is one of the first to strike a stranger who lands at Galle or Colombo is the bright red colour of the streets and roads . . . and the ubiquity of the fine red dust which penetrates every crevice and imparts its own tint to every neglected article. Natives resident in these localities are easily recognisable elsewhere by the general hue of their dress. This is occasioned by the prevalence . . . of laterite, or, as the Singhalese call it, cabook.\"- Tennent's Ceylon, i. 17.\n", "cabul": "&c., n.p. This name (K\u0101bul) of the chief city of N. Afghanistan, now so familiar, is perhaps traceable in Ptolemy, who gives in that same region a people called *KABOLI=TAI, and a city called *KA/BOURA. Perhaps, however, one or both may be corroborated by the NA/RDOS *KABALI/TH of the Periplus. The accent of K\u0101bul is most distinctly on the first and long syllable, but English mouths are very perverse in error here. Moore accents the last syllable:\n \". . . pomegranates full Of melting sweetness, and the pears And sunniest apples that Caubul In all its thousand gardens bears.\" Light of the Harem.\n Mr. Arnold does likewise in Sohrab and Rustam:\n \"But as a troop of pedlars from Cabool, Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus. . . .\"\n It was told characteristically of the late Lord Ellenborough that, after his arrival in India, though for months he heard the name correctly spoken by his councillors and his staff, he persisted in calling it C\u0103bo\u0304ol till he met Dost Mahommed Khan.

This occurs in the App. to the Journal d'Antoine Galland, at Constantinople in 1673: \"Dragmes de Cacouli, drogue qu'on use dans le Cahue,\" i.e. in coffee (ii. 206). This is Pers. Arab. \u1e33\u0101kula for Cardamom, as in the quotation from Garcia. We may remark that K\u0101\u1e33ula was a place somewhere on the Gulf of Siam, famous for its fine aloes-wood (see Ibn Batuta, iv. 240-44).

The suggestion is confirmed by this advertisement:\n 1792. -- \"By R. Henderson . . . A Quantity of Tea in Quarter Chests and Caddies, imported last season. . . .\" -- Madras Courier, Dec. 2.\n", "cadet": "s. (From Prov. capdet, and Low Lat. capitettum, [dim. of caput, 'head'] Skeat). This word is of course by no means exclusively Anglo-Indian, but it was in exceptionally common and familiar use in India, as all young officers appointed to the Indian army went out to that country as cadets, and were only promoted to ensigncies and posted to regiments after their arrival -- in olden days sometimes a considerable time after their arrival. In those days there was a building in Fort William known as the 'Cadet Barrack'; and for some time early in last century the cadets after their arrival were sent to a sort of college at Baraset; a system which led to no good, and was speedily abolished.\n 1763. -- \"We should very gladly comply with your request for sending you young persons to be brought up as assistants in the Engineering branch, but as we find it extremely difficult to procure such, you will do well to employ any who have a talent that way among the cadets or others.\" -- Court's Letter, in Long, 290.\n 1769. -- \"Upon our leaving England, the cadets and writers used the great cabin promiscuously; but finding they were troublesome and quarrelsome, we brought a Bill into the house for their ejectment.\" -- Life of Lord Teignmouth, i. 15.\n 1781. -- \"The Cadets of the end of the years 1771 and beginning of 1772 served in the country four years as Cadets and carried the musket all the time.\" -- Letter in Hicky's Bengal Gazette, Sept. 29.\n", "cadjan": "s.

K\u0101fir, pl. Kofra, 'an infidel, an unbeliever in Isl\u0101m.' As the Arabs applied this to Pagan negroes, among others, the Portuguese at an early date took it up in this sense, and our countrymen from them. A further appropriation in one direction has since made the name specifically that of the black tribes of South Africa, whom we now call, or till recently did call, Caffres. It was also applied in the Philippine Islands to the Papuas of N. Guinea, and the Alfuras of the Moluccas, brought into the slavemarket. \n In another direction the word has become a quasi-proper name of the (more or less) fair, and non-Mahommedan, tribes of Hindu-Kush, sometimes called more specifically the Si\u0101hposh or 'black-robed' Cafirs.\n The term is often applied malevolently by Mahommedans to Christians, and this is probably the origin of the mistake pervading some of the early Portuguese narratives, especially the Roteiro of Vasco da Gama, which described many of the Hindu and Indo-Chinese States as being Christian.*\n [c. 1300. -- \"K\u0101fir.\" See under LACK.]\n c. 1404. -- Of a people near China: \"They were Christians after the manner of those of Cathay.\" -- Clavijo by Markham, 141.\n \" And of India: \"The people of India are Christians, the Lord and most part of the people, after the manner of the Greeks; and among them also are other Christians who mark themselves with fire in the face, and their creed is different from that of the others; for those who thus mark themselves with fire are less esteemed than the others.

Filet (see p. 140) gives six different trees as producing the oil, which is derived from the distillation of the leaves. The chief of these trees is Melaleuca leucadendron, L., a tree diffused from the Malay Peninsula to N.S. Wales. The drug and tree were first described by Rumphius, who died 1693.

Sir Joseph Hooker writes: \"When I was in the Navy, haricot beans were in constant use as a substitute for potatoes and in Brazil and elsewhere, were called Calavances. I do not remember whether they were the seed of Phaseolus lunatus or vulgaris, or of Dolichos sinensis, alias Catjang\" (see CAJAN).

The word is Ar. kala'i, 'tin,' which according to certain Arabic writers was so called from a mine in India called \u1e33ala'. In spite of the different initial and terminal letters, it seems at least possible that the place meant was the same that the old Arab geographers called Kalah, near which they place mines of tin (al-\u1e33ala'i), and which was certainly somewhere about the coast of Malacca, possibly, as has been suggested, at Kadah* or as we write it, Quedda. [See \u0100\u012bn, tr. Jarrett, iii 48.]\n The tin produce of that region is well known. Kalang is indeed also a name of tin in Malay, which may have been the true origin of the word before us. It may be added that the small State of Salangor between Malacca and Perak was formerly known as Nagri-Kalang, or the 'Tin Country,' and that the place on the coast where the British Resident lives It may be observed, however, that kw\u0101la in Malay indicates the estuary of a navigable river, and denominates many small ports in the Malay region. The Kalah of the early Arabs is probably the *KW=LI PO/LIS of Ptolemy's Tables.\n is called Klang (see Miss Bird, Golden Chersonese, 210, 215). The Portuguese have the forms calaim and calin, with the nasal termination so frequent in their Eastern borrowings. Bluteau explains calaim as 'Tin of India, finer than ours.' The old writers seem to have hesitated about the identity with tin, and the word is confounded in one quotation below with Tootnague (q.v.). The French use calin. In the P. version of the Book of Numbers (ch. xxxi. v. 22) \u1e33ala'\u012b is used for 'tin.' See on this word Quatrem\u00e8re in the Journal des Savans, Dec. 1846.\n c. 920. -- \"Kalah is the focus of the trade in aloeswood, in camphor, in sandalwood, in ivory, in the lead which is called alKala'i.\" -- Relation des Voyages, &c., i. 94.\n c. 1154. -- \"Thence to the Isles of Lanki\u0101li\u016bs is reckoned two days, and from the latter to the Island of Kalah 5. . . .

An ancient kingdom in the eastern part of Indo-China, once great and powerful: now fallen, and under the 'protectorate' of France, whose Saigon colony it adjoins. The name, like so many others of Indo-China since the days of Ptolemy, is of Skt. origin, being apparently a transfer of the name of a nation and country on the N.W. frontier of India, Kamboja, supposed to have been about the locality of Chitral or Kafiristan. Ignoring this, fantastic Chinese and other etymologies have been invented for the name. In the older Chinese annals (c. 1200 B.C.) this region had the name of Fu-nan; from the period after our era, when the kingdom of Camboja had become powerful, it was known to the Chinese as Chin-la. Its power seems to have extended at one time westward, perhaps to the shores of the B. of Bengal. Ruins of extraordinary vastness and architectural elaboration are numerous, and have attracted great attention since M. Mouhot's visit in 1859; though they had been mentioned by 16th century missionaries, and some of the buildings when standing in splendour were described by a Chinese visitor at the end of the 13th century. The Cambojans proper call themselves Khmer, a name which seems to have given rise to singular confusions (see COMAR).

The camphor of China and Japan, from Cinnamomum Camphora. (These are the two chief camphors of commerce; the first immensely exceeding the second in market value: see Marco Polo, Bk. iii. ch. xi.

The camphor of Blumea balsamifera, D.C., produced and used in China under the name of ngai camphor.\n The relative ratios of value in the Canton market may be roundly given as b, 1; c, 10; a, 80.\n The first Western mention of this drug, as was pointed out by Messrs Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger, occurs in the Greek medical writer A\u00ebtius (see below), but it probably came through the Arabs, as is indicated by the ph, or f of the Arab k\u0101f\u016br, representing the Skt. karp\u016bra. It has been suggested that the word was originally Javanese, in which language k\u0101p\u016br appears to mean both 'lime' and 'camphor.'\n Moodeen Sheriff says that k\u0103f\u016br is used (in Ind. Materia Medica) for 'amber.' T\u0101bash\u012br (see TABASHEER), is, according to the same writer, called b\u0101ns-k\u0101f\u016br 'bamboo - camphor'; and ras-k\u0101f\u016br (mercury-camphor) is an impure subchloride of mercury. According to the same authority, the varieties of camphor now met with in the bazars of S. India are -- 1. k\u0101f\u016br-i-\u1e33ai\u1e63\u016br\u012b, which is in Tamil called pach'ch'ai (i.e. crude karuppuram; 2. S\u016brat\u012b k\u0101f\u016br; 3. ch\u012bn\u012b; 4. batai (from the Batta country?). The first of these names is a curious instance of the perpetuation of a blunder, originating in the misreading of loose Arabic writing. The name is unquestionably fan\u1e63\u016br\u012b, which carelessness as to points has converted into \u1e33ai\u1e63\u016br\u012b (as above, and in Blochmann's \u0100\u012bn, i. 79). The camphor alfan\u1e63\u016br\u012b is mentioned as early as by Avicenna, and by Marco Polo, and came from a place called Pans\u016br in Sumatra, perhaps the same as Barus, which has now long given its name to the costly Sumatran drug.\n (iv. 241) that the camphor of Sumatra (and Borneo) was produced in the inside of a cane, filling the joints between knot and knot, may be explained by the statement of Barbosa (p. 204), that the Borneo camphor as exported was packed in tubes of bamboo. This camphor is by Barbosa and some other old writers called 'eatable camphor' (da mangiare), because used in medicine and with betel.\n Our form of the word seems to have come from the Sp. alcanfor and canfora, through the French camphre.

Properly Kanna\u1e0da. This name has long been given to that part of the West coast which lies below the Ghauts, from Mt. Dely northward to the Goa territory; and now to the two British districts constituted out of that tract, viz. N. and S. Canara. This appropriation of the name, however, appears to be of European origin. The name, probably meaning 'black country' [Dravid. kar, 'black,' n\u0101du, 'country'], from the black cotton soil prevailing there, was properly synonymous with Kar\u1e47\u0101taka (see CARNATIC), and apparently a corruption of that word. Our quotations show that throughout the sixteenth century the term was applied to the country above the Ghauts, sometimes to the whole kingdom of Narsinga or Vijayanagar (see BISNAGAR). Gradually, and probably owing to local application at Goa, where the natives seem to have been from the first known to the Portuguese as Canarijs, a term which in the old Portuguese works means the Konkani people and language of Goa, the name became appropriated to the low country on the coast between Goa and Malabar, which was subject to the kingdom in question, much in the same way that the name Carnatic came at a later date to be misapplied on the other side of the Peninsula.\n The Kanara or Canarese language is spoken over a large tract above the Ghauts, and as far north as Bidar (see Caldwell, Introd. p. 33). It is only one of several languages spoken in the British districts of Canara, and that only in a small portion, viz. near Kund\u0101pur. Tulu is the chief language in the Southern District. Kanadam occurs in the great Tanjore inscription of the 11th century.\n 1516. -- \"Beyond this river commences the Kingdom of Narsinga, which contains five very large provinces, each with a language of its own.

The word is Mahr. and Tel. kha\u1e47\u1e0di, written in Tam. and Mal. ka\u1e47\u1e0di, or Mal. ka\u1e47\u1e6di, [and comes from the Skt. kha\u1e47\u1e0d, 'to divide.'

This name of crystallized sugar, though it came no doubt to Europe from the P.-Ar. \u1e33and (P. also shakar \u1e33and; Sp. azucar cande; It. candi and zucchero candito; Fr. sucre candi) is of Indian origin. There is a Skt. root kha\u1e47\u1e0d, 'to break,' whence kha\u1e47\u1e0da, 'broken,' also applied in various compounds to granulated and candied sugar. But there is also Tam. kar-ka\u1e47\u1e0da, kala-ka\u1e47\u1e0da, Mal. ka\u1e47\u1e0di,kalka\u1e47\u1e0di, and kalka\u1e47\u1e6du, which may have been the direct source of the P. and Ar. adoption of the word, and perhaps its original, from a Dravidian word= 'lump.' [The Dravidian terms mean 'stone-piece.']\n A German writer, long within last century (as we learn from Mahn, quoted in Diez's Lexicon), appears to derive candy from Candia, \"because most of the sugar which the Venetians imported was brought from that island\" -- a fact probably invented for the nonce. But the writer was the same wiseacre who (in the year 1829) characterised the book of Marco Polo as a \"clumsily compiled ecclesiastical fiction disguised as a Book of Travels\" (see Introduction to Marco Polo, 2nd ed. pp. 112-113).\n c. 1343. -- \"A centinajo si vende giengiovo, cannella, lacca, incenso, indaco . . . verzino scorzuto, zucchero . . . zucchero candi . . . porcellane . . . costo . . .\"- Pegolotti, p. 134.\n 1461. -- \". . .

Hamilton, i. 371.\n", "cangue": "s, A square board, or portable pillory of wood, used in China as a punishment, or rather, as Dr. Wells Williams says, as a kind of censure, carrying no disgrace; strange as that seems to us, with whom the essence of the pillory is disgrace. The frame weighs up to 30 lbs., a weight limited by law. It is made to rest on the shoulders without chafing the neck, but so broad as to prevent the wearer from feeding himself. It is generally taken off at night (Giles, [and see Gray, China, i. 55 seqq.]).\n The Cangue was introduced into China by the Tartar dynasty of Wei in the 5th century, and is first mentioned under A.D. 481. In the Kwang-yun (a Chin. Dict. published A.D. 1009) it is called kanggiai (modern mandarin hiang-hiai), i.e. 'Neck-fetter.' From this old form probably the Anamites have derived their word for it, gong, and the Cantonese k'ang-ka, 'to wear the Cangue,' a survival (as frequently happens in Chinese vernaculars) of an ancient term with a new orthography. It is probable that the Portuguese took the word from one of these latter forms, and associated it with their own canga, 'an ox-yoke,' or 'porter's yoke for carrying burdens.' [This view is rejected by the N.E.D. on the authority of Prof. Legge, and the word is regarded as derived from the Port. form given above. In reply to an enquiry, Prof. Giles writes: \"I am entirely of opinion that the word is from the Port., and not from any Chinese term.\"] The thing is alluded to by F. M. Pinto and other early writers on China, who do not give it a name.\n Something of this kind was in use in countries of Western Asia, called in P. dosh\u0101ka (bilignum). And this word is applied to the Chinese cangue in one of our quotations. Dosh\u0101ka, however, is explained in the lexicon Burh\u0101n-i-\u1e32\u0101\u1e6di as 'a piece of timber with two branches placed on the neck of a criminal' (Quatrem\u00e8re, in Not. et Extr. xiv. 172, 173).\n 1420. -- \". . . made the ambassadors come forward side by side with certain prisoners. . . .

KERA/TION, a bean of the KERATEI/A or carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua, L.). This bean, like the Indian rati (see RUTTEE) was used as a weight, and thence also it gave name to a coin Sir J. Hooker observes that the fact that there is an acid and a sweet-fruited variety (blimbee) of this plant indicates a very old cultivation.\n of account, if not actual. To discuss the carat fully would be a task of extreme complexity, and would occupy several pages.\n Under the name of siliqua it was the 24th part of the golden solidus of Constantine, which was again=\u2159 of an ounce. Hence this carat was= 1\u2044144 of an ounce. In the passage from St. Isidore quoted below, the cerates is distinct from the siliqua, and = 1\u00bd siliquae. This we cannot explain, but the siliqua Graeca was the KERA/TION; and the siliqua as 1\u204424 of a solidus is the parent of the carat in all its uses. [See Prof. Gardner, in Smith, Dict. Ant. 3rd ed. ii. 675.] Thus we find the carat at Constantinople in the 14th century=1\u204424 of the hyperpera or Greek bezant, which was a debased representative of the solidus; and at Alexandria 1\u204424 of the Arabic d\u012bn\u0101r, which was a purer representative of the solidus. And so, as the Roman uncia signified 1\u204412 of any unit (compare ounce, inch), so to a certain extent carat came to signify 1\u204424. Dictionaries give Arab. \u1e33irr\u0101\u1e6d as \"1\u204424 of an ounce.\" Of this we do not know the evidence. The English Cyclopaedia (s.v.) again states that \"the carat was originally the 24th part of the marc, or half-pound, among the French, from whom the word came.\" This sentence perhaps contains more than one error; but still both of these allegations exhibit the carat as 1\u204424th part. Among our goldsmiths the term is still used to measure the proportionate quality of gold; pure gold being put at 24 carats, gold with 1\u204412 alloy at 22 carats, with \u00bc alloy at 18 carats, &c. And the word seems also (like Anna, q.v.) sometimes to have been used to express a proportionate scale in other matters, as is illustrated by a curious passage in Marco Polo, quoted below.\n The carat is also used as a weight for diamonds. As 1\u2044144 of an ounce troy this ought to make it 3\u2153 grains. But these carats really run 151\u00bd to the ounce troy, so that the diamond carat is 3\u2159 grs. nearly. This we presume was adopted direct from some foreign system in which the carat was 1\u2044144 of the local ounce. [See Ball, Tavernier, ii. 447.]\n c.

The Portuguese caravel is described by the latter as a 'round vessel' (i.e. not long and sharp like a galley), with lateen sails, ordinarily of 200 tons burthen.

They do not know the name Kareng, nor have they one name for their own race; distinguishing, among these whom we call Karens, three tribes, Sgaw, Pwo, and Bghai, which differ somewhat in customs and traditions, and especially in language. \"The results of the labours among them of the American Baptist Mission have the appearance of being almost miraculous, and it is not going too far to state that the cessation of blood feuds, and the peaceable way in which the various tribes are living . . . and have lived together since they came under British rule, is far more due to the influence exercised over them by the missionaries than to the measures adopted by the English Government, beneficial as these doubtless have been\" (Br.

India found a region which embraces Mysore and part of Teling\u0101na (in fact the kingdom of Vijayanagara), called the Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6daka country, and this was identical in application (and probably in etymology) with the Canara country (q.v.) of the older Portuguese writers. The Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6daka became extended, especially in connection with the rule of the Nabobs of Arcot, who partially occupied the Vijayanagara territory, and were known as Naw\u0101bs of the Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6daka, to the country below the Ghauts, on the eastern side of the Peninsula, just as the other form Canara had become extended to the country below the Western Ghauts; and eventually among the English the term Carnatic came to be understood in a sense more or less restricted to the eastern low country, though never quite so absolutely as Canara has become restricted to the western low country.

CARRACK, s. A kind of vessel of burden from the Middle Ages down to the end of the 17th century. The character of the earlier carrack cannot be precisely defined. But the larger cargo-ships of the Portuguese in the trade of the 16th century were generally so styled, and these were sometimes of enormous tonnage, with 3 or 4 decks. Charnock (Marine Architecture, ii. p. 9) has a plate of a Genoese carrack of 1542. He also quotes the description of a Portuguese carrack taken by Sir John Barrough in 1592. It was of 1,600 tons burden, whereof 900 merchandize; carried 32 brass pieces and between 600 and 700 passengers (?); was built with 7 decks. The word (L. Lat.) carraca is regarded by Skeat as properly carrica, from carricare, It. caricare, 'to lade, to charge.' This is possible; but it would be well to examine if it be not from the Ar. \u1e25ar\u0101\u1e33ah, a word which the dictionaries explain as 'fire-ship'; though this is certainly not always the meaning. Dozy is inclined to derive carraca (which is old in Sp. he says) from \u1e33ar\u0101\u1e33ir, the pl. of \u1e33ur\u1e33\u016br or \u1e33ur\u1e33\u016bra (see CARACOA). And \u1e33ur\u1e33\u016bra itself he thinks may have come from carricare, which already occurs in St. Jerome. So that Mr. Skeat's origin is possibly correct. [The N.E.D. refers to carraca, of which the origin is said to be uncertain. ] Ibn Batuta uses the word twice at least for a state barge or something of that kind (see Cathay p. 499, and Ibn Bat. ii. 116; iv. 289) The like use occurs several times in Makrizi (e.g. I. i. 143; I. ii. 66; and II. i. 24). Quatrem\u00e8re at the place first quoted observes that the \u1e25ar\u0101\u1e33ah was not a fire ship in our sense, but a vessel with a high deck from which fire could be thrown; but that it could also be used as a transport vessel, and was so used on sea and land.\n 1338. -- \". . . after that we embarked at Venice on board a certain carrack, and sailed down the Adriatic Sea.\" -- FriarPasqual, in Cathay, &c., 231.\n 1383. -- \"Eodem tempore venit in magna\u0302 tempestate ad Sandevici portum navis quam dicunt carika (mirae) magnitudinis, plena divitiis, quae facile inopiam totius terrae relevare potuisset, si incolarum invidia permisisset. \" -- T.

This is the botanical name (Caryota urens, L.) of a magnificent palm growing in the moister forest regions, as in the Western Ghauts and in Eastern Bengal, in Ceylon, and in Burma. A conspicuous character is presented by its enormous bipinnate leaves, somewhat resembling colossal bracken-fronds, 15 to 25 feet long, 10 to 12 in width; also by the huge pendent clusters of its inflorescence and seeds, the latter like masses of rosaries 10 feet long and upwards. It affords much Toddy (q.v.) made into spirit and sugar, and is the tree chiefly affording these products in Ceylon, where it is called Kitul. It also affords a kind of sago, and a woolly substance found at the foot of the leaf-stalks is sometimes used for caulking, and forms a good tinder. The sp. name urens is derived from the acrid, burning taste of the fruit. It is called, according to Brandis, the Mh\u0101r-palm in Western India. We know of no Hindustani or familiar Anglo-Indian name. [Watt, (Econ. Dict. ii. 206) says that it is known in Bombay as the Hill or Sago palm. It has penetrated in Upper India as far as Chun\u0101r.] The name Caryota seems taken from Pliny, but his application is to a kind of date-palm; his statement that it afforded the best wine of the East probably suggested the transfer.\n c.

T. iv. 149. A mistake, however.\n 1861. -- See quotation under PEEPUL.\n", "cash": "s. A name applied by Europeans to sundry coins of low value in various parts of the Indies. The word in its original form is of extreme antiquity, \"Skt. karsha . . . a weight of silver or gold equal to 1\u2044400 of a Tul\u0101\" (Williams, Skt. Dict.; and see also a Note on the K\u0101rsha, or rather k\u0101rsh\u0101pa\u1e47a, as a copper coin of great antiquity, in E. Thomas's Patha\u0302n Kings of Delhi, 361-362). From the Tam. form k\u0101su, or perhaps from some Konkani form which we have not traced, the Portuguese seem to have made caixa, whence the English cash. In Singalese also k\u0101si is used for 'coin' in general. The English term was appropriated in the monetary system which prevailed in S. India up to 1818; thus there was a copper coin for use in Madras struck in England in 1803, which bears on the reverse, \"XX Cash.\" A figure of this coin is given in Ruding. Under this system 80 cash=1 fanam, 42 fanams=1 star pagoda. But from an early date the Portuguese had applied caixa to the small money of foreign systems, such as those of the Malay Islands, and especially to that of the Chinese. In China the word cash is used, by Europeans and their hangers-on, as the synonym of the Chinese le and tsien, which are those coins made of an alloy of copper and lead with a square hole in the middle, which in former days ran 1000 to the liang or tael (q.v.), and which are strung in certain numbers on cords. [This type of money, as was recently pointed out by Lord Avebury, is a survival of the primitive currency, which was in the shape of an axe.] Rouleaux of coin thus strung are represented on the surviving bank-notes of the Ming dynasty (A.D. 1368 onwards), and probably were also on the notes of their Mongol predecessors. \n The existence of the distinct English word cash may probably have affected the form of the corruption before us. This word had a European origin from It. cassa, French caisse, 'the moneychest': this word in book-keeping having given name to the heading of account under which actual disbursements of coin were entered (see Wedgwood and N.E.D. s.v.). In Minsheu (2nd ed. 1627) the present sense of the word is not attained.

The tree, fruit, or nut of the Anacardium occidentale, an American tree which must have been introduced early into India by the Portuguese, for it was widely diffused apparently as a wild tree long before the end of the 17th century, and it is described as an Indian tree by Acosta, who wrote in 1578. Crawfurd also speaks of it as abundant, and in full bearing, in the jungly islets of Hastings Archipelago, off the coast of Camboja (Emb. to Siam, &c., i. 103) [see Teele's note on Linschoten, Hak.

The so-called fruit is the fleshy top of the peduncle which bears the nut.

This Spanish and Portuguese word, though Dozy gives it only as pr\u00eatre chr\u00e9tien, is frequently employed by old travellers, and writers on Eastern subjects, to denote Mahommedan divines (mullas and the like). It may be suspected to have arisen from a confusion of two Arabic terms -- k\u0101\u1e0di (see CAZEE) and \u1e33ash\u012bsh or \u1e33as\u012bs, 'a Christian Presbyter' (from a Syriac root signifying senuit). Indeed we sometimes find the precise word \u1e33ash\u012b\u1e63h (Caxix) used by Christian writers as if it were the special title of a Mahommedan theologian, instead of being, as it really is, the special and technical title of a Christian priest (a fact which gives Mount Athos its common Turkish name of Kash\u012bsh D\u0101gh). In the first of the following quotations the word appears to be applied by the Mussulman historian to pagan priests, and the word for churches to pagan temples. In the others, except that from Major Millingen, it is applied by Christian writers to Mahommedan divines, which is indeed its recognised signification in Spanish and Portuguese. In Jarric's Thesaurus (Jesuit Missions, 1606) the word Cacizius is constantly used in this sense.\n c. 1310. -- \"There are 700 churches (kal\u012bs\u012ba) resembling fortresses, and every one of them overflowing with presbyters (\u1e33ash\u012bsh\u0101n) without faith, and monks without religion.\" -- Description of the Chinese City of Khanzai (Hangchau) in Was\u0101f's History (see also Marco Polo, ii. 196).\n 1404. -- \"The town was inhabited by Moorish hermits called Caxixes; and many people came to them on pilgrimage, and they healed many diseases.\" -- Markham's Clavijo, 79.\n 1514. -- \"And so, from one to another, the message passed through four or five hands, till it came to a Gazizi, whom we should call a bishop or prelate, who stood at the King's feet. . . .\" -- Letter of Giov. de Empoli, in Archiv.

[See the extraordinary derivation of Hamilton below.] Mr. Elphinstone prefers to write \"Cast.\"\n We do not find that the early Portuguese writer Barbosa (1516) applies the word casta to the divisions of Hindu society. He calls these divisions in Narsinga and Malabar so many leis de gentios, i.e. 'laws' of the heathen, in the sense of sectarian rules of life. But he uses the word casta in a less technical way, which shows how it should easily have passed into the technical sense. Thus, speaking of the King of Calicut: \"This King keeps 1000 women, to whom he gives regular maintenance, and they always go to his court to act as the sweepers of his palaces . . . these are ladies, and of good family\" (estas saom fidalgas e de boa casta. -- In Coll. of Lisbon Academy, ii. 316). So also Castanheda: \"There fled a knight who was called Ferna\u0303o Lopez, homem de boa casta\" (iii. 239).

G. Palgrave, in Fortnightly Rev., cx. 226.\n In the Madras Pres. castes are also 'Right-hand' and 'Left-hand.' This distinction represents the agricultural classes on the one hand, and the artizans, &c., on the other, as was pointed out by F. W. Ellis. In the old days of Ft. St. George, factionfights between the two were very common, and the terms right-hand and left-hand castes occur early in the old records of that settlement, and fre quently in Mr. Talboys Wheeler's extracts from them. They are mentioned by Couto. [See Nelson, Madura, Pt. ii. p. 4; Oppert. Orig. Inhab. p. 57.]\n Sir Walter Elliot considers this feud to be \"nothing else than the occasional outbreak of the smouldering antagonism between Brahmanism and Buddhism, although in the lapse of ages both parties have lost sight of the fact. The points on which they split now are mere trifles, such as parading on horse-back or in a palankeen in procession, erecting a pandal or marriageshed on a given number of pillars, and claiming to carry certain flags, &c. The right-hand party is headed by the Brahmans, and includes the Parias, who assume the van, beating their tom-toms when they come to blows. The chief of the left-hand are the Panchalars [i.e. the Five Classes, workers in metal and stone, &c.], followed by the Pallars and workers in leather, who sound their long trumpets and engage the Parias.\" (In Journ.

In such cases the usage may possibly have come directly from the Port. alta casta, casta baixa, in the sense of breed or strain.\n", "castees": "s. Obsolete.

The tree has a considerable superficial resemblance to a larch or other finely-feathered conifer, making a very acceptable variety in the hot plains, where real pines will not grow.

An astringent extract from the wood of several species of Acacia (Acacia catechu, Willd.), the khair, and Acacia suma, Kurz, Ac. sundra, D. C. and probably more. The extract is called in H. ka\u1e6dth, [Skt. kvath, 'to decoct'], but the two first com mercial names which we have given are doubtless taken from the southern forms of the word, e.g. Can. k\u0101chu, Tam. k\u0101su, Malay kachu. De Orta, whose judgments are always worthy of respect, considered it to be the lycium of the ancients, and always applied that name to it; but Dr. Royle has shown that lycium was an extract from certain species of berberis, known in the bazars as raso\u0304t. Cutch is first mentioned by Barbosa, among the drugs imported into Malacca. But it remained unknown in Europe till brought from Japan about the middle of the 17th century. In the 4th ed. of Schr\u00f6der's Pharmacop. Medico-chymica, Lyons, 1654, it is briefly described as Catechu or Terra Japonica, \"genus terrae exoticae\" (Hanbury and Fliickiger, 214).

In the 16th century, and even later, from a misunderstanding of the medieval travellers, Cathay was supposed to be a country north of China, and is so represented in many maps.

A stone of value found in Ceylon. It is described by Dana as a form of chalcedony of a greenish grey, with glowing internal reflections, whence the Portuguese call it Olho de gato, which our word translates. It appears from the quotation below from Dr. Royle that the Beli oculus of Pliny has been identified with the cat's-eye, which may well be the case, though the odd circumstance noticed by Royle may be only a curious coincidence. [The phrase bill\u012b k\u012b \u0101nkh does not appear in Platt's Dict. The usual name is lahsaniy\u0101, 'like garlic.' The Burmese are said to call it kyoung, 'a cat.']\n c.

A weight used in China, and by the Chinese introduced into the Archipelago. The Chinese name is kin or chin. The word k\u0101t\u012b or kat\u012b is Malayo-Javanese. It is equal to 16 taels, i.e. 1\u2153 lb. avoird. or 625 grammes. This is the weight fixed by treaty; but in Chinese trade it varies from 4 oz. to 28 oz.; the lowest value being used by tea-vendors at Peking, the highest by coal-merchants in Honan.\n [1554. -- \"Cate.\" See quotation under PECUL.]\n 1598. -- \"Everie Catte is as much as 20 Portingall ounces.\" -- Linschoten, 34; [Hak.

In this passage, however, Cathayes seems to be a strange blunder of Purchas or his copyist for Cwt. Suckette is probably Malay sukat, \"a measure, a stated quantity.\" [The word appears as suckell in a letter of 1615 (Foster, iii. 175). Mr. Skeat suggests that it is a misreading for Pecul. Sukat, he says, means 'to measure anything' (indefinitely), but is never used for a definite measure.]\n b. The word catty occurs in another sense in the following passage. A note says that \"Catty or more literally Kuttoo is a Tamil word signifying batta\" (q.v.). But may it not rather be a clerical error for batty?\n 1659. -- \"If we should detain them longer we are to give them catty.\" -- Letter in Wheeler, i. 162.\n", "catur": "s. A light rowing vessel used on the coast of Malabar in the early days of the Portuguese. We have not been able to trace the name to any Indian source, [unless possibly Skt. chatura, 'swift']. Is it not pro bably the origin of our 'cutter'? We see that Sir R. Burton in his Commentary on Camoens (vol. iv. 391) says: \"Catur is the Arab. kat\u012breh, a small craft, our 'cutter.'\" [This view is rejected by the N.E.D., which regards it as an English word from 'to cut.'] We cannot say when cutter was introduced in marine use. We cannot find it in Dampier, nor in Robinson Crusoe; the first instance we have found is that quoted below from Anson's Voyage. [The N.E.D. has nothing earlier than 1745.]\n Bluteau gives catur as an Indian term indicating a small war vessel, which in a calm can be aided by oars. Jal (Arch\u00e9ologie Navale, ii. 259) quotes Witsen as saying that the Caturi or Almadias were Calicut vessels, having a length of 12 to 13 paces (60 to 65 feet), sharp at both ends, and curving back, using both sails and oars. But there was a larger kind, 80 feet long, with only 7 or 8 feet beam.\n 1510. -- \"There is also another kind of vessel. . . . These are all made of one piece . . . sharp at both ends.

Cutter also occurs pp. 111, 129, 150, and other places.\n", "cauvery": "n.p. The great river of S. India. Properly Tam. K\u0101viri, or rather K\u0101veri, and Sanscritized K\u0101v\u0113r\u012b. The earliest mention is that of Ptolemy, who writes the name (after the Skt. form) *XA/BHROS (sc. POTAMO/S). The *KAMA/RA of the Periplus (c. A.D. 80-90) probably, however, represents the same name, the *XABHRI\\S E)MPORIO/N of Ptolemy. The meaning of the name has been much debated, and several plausible but unsatisfactory explanations have been given. Thus the Skt. form K\u0101v\u0113r\u012b has been explained from that language by k\u0101v\u0113ra 'saffron.' A river in the Tamil country is, however, hardly likely to have a non-mythological Skt. name. The Cauvery in flood, like other S. Indian rivers, assumes a reddish hue. And the form K\u0101v\u0113ri has been explained by Bp. Caldwell as possibly from the Dravidian k\u0101vi, 'red ochre' or k\u0101 (k\u0101-va), 'a grove,' and \u0113r-u, Tel. 'a river,' \u0113r-i, Tam. 'a sheet of water'; thus either 'red river' or 'grove river.' [The Madras Admin. Gloss. takes it from k\u0101, Tam. 'grove,' and \u0113ri, Tam. 'tank,' from its original source in a garden tank.] K\u0101-viri, however, the form found in inscriptions, affords a more satisfactory Tamil interpretation, viz. K\u0101 - viri, 'grove-extender,' or developer. Any one who has travelled along the river will have noticed the thick groves all along the banks, which form a remarkable feature of the stream.\n c. 150 A.D.- \"*XABH/ROU POTAMOU= E)KBOLA/I *XABHRI\\S E)MPORIO/N.\" -- Ptolemy, lib. vii. 1.\n The last was probably represented by Kaveripatan.\n c. 545. -- \"Then there is Sieled\u0113ba, i.e. Taprobane . . . and then again on the Continent, and further back, is Marallo, which exports conch-shells; Kaber, which exports alabandinum.\" -- Cosmas, Topog.

It may represent the genus Equula, of which 12 spp. are described by Day (Fishes of India, pp. 237-242), two being named by different zoologists E. caballa. But Dr. Day hesitates to identify the fish now in question. The fish mentioned in the fourth and fifth quotations may be the same species; but that in the fifth seems doubtful.

It is an article of considerable native trade, and is chiefly exported to China\" (p. 204). [The word, according to Mr. Skeat, is probably kayu, 'wood,' lakh, 'red dye' (see LAC), but the combined form is not in Klinkert, nor are these trees in Ridley's plant list.

Arab. \u1e33\u0101\u1e0di, 'a judge,' the letter zw\u0101d with which it is spelt being always pronounced in India like a z. The form Cadi, familiar from its use in the old version of the Arabian Nights, comes to us from the Levant. The word with the article, al-\u1e33\u0101di, becomes in Spanish alcalde;* not alcaide, which is from \u1e33\u0101'\u012bd, 'a chief'; nor alguacil, which is from waz\u012br. So Dozy and Engelmann, no doubt correctly. But in Pinto, cap. 8, we find \"ao guazil da justica q\u0303 em elles he como corregedor entre nos\"; where guazil seems to stand for \u1e33\u0101\u1e93\u012b.\n It is not easy to give an accurate account of the position of the \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b in British India, which has gone through variations of which a distinct record cannot be found. But the following outline is believed to be substantially correct.\n Dr. R. Rost observes to us that the Arabic letter \u1e93w\u0101d is pronounced by the Malays like ll (see also Crawfurd's Malay Grammar, p. 7). And it is curious to find a transfer of the same letter into Spanish as ld. In Malay \u1e33\u0101\u1e0d\u012b becomes \u1e33\u0101ll\u012b.\n Under Adawlut I have given a brief sketch of the history of the judiciary under the Company in the Bengal Presidency. Down to 1790 the greater part of the administration of criminal justice was still in the hands of native judges, and other native officials of various kinds, though under European supervision in varying forms. But the native judiciary, except in positions of a quite subordinate character, then ceased. It was, however, still in substance Mahommedan law that was administered in criminal cases, and also in civil cases between Mahommedans as affecting succession, &c. And a \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b and a Muft\u012b were retained in the Provincial Courts of Appeal and Circuit as the exponents of Mahommedan law, and the deliverers of a formal Futwa. There was also a K\u0101z\u012b-al-\u1e32o\u1e93\u0101t, or chief \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b of Bengal, Behar and Orissa, attached to the Sudder Courts of Dewanny and Nizamut, assisted by two Muftis, and these also gave written futwas on references from the District Courts.\n The style of \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b and Muft\u012b presumably continued in formal existence in connection with the Sudder Courts till the abolition of these in 1862; but with the earlier abolition of the Provincial Courts in 1829-31 it had quite ceased, in this sense, to be familiar. In the District Courts the corresponding exponents were in English officially designated Lawofficers, and, I believe, in official vernacular, as well as commonly among Anglo-Indians, Moolvees (q.v.).\n Under the article LAW-OFFICER, it will be seen that certain trivial cases were, at the discretion of the magistrate, referred for disposal by the Law-officer of the district. And the latter, from this fact, as well as, perhaps, from the tradition of the elders, was in some parts of Bengal popularly known as 'the \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b.' \"In the Magistrate's office,\" writes my friend Mr. Seton - Karr, \"it was quite common to speak of this case as referred to the joint magistrate, and that to the Chho\u1e6d\u0101 \u1e62\u0101\u1e25ib (the Assistant), and that again to the \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b.\"\n But the duties of the \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b popularly so styled and officially recognised, had, almost from the beginning of the century, become limited to certain notarial functions, to the performance and registration of Mahommedan marriages, and some other matters connected with the social life of their co-religionists. To these functions must also be added as regards the 18th century and the earlier years of the 19th, duties in connection with distraint for rent on behalf of Zemindars. There were such \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012bs nominated by Government in towns and pergunnas, with great variation in the area of the localities over which they officiated. The Act XI. of 1864, which repealed the laws relating to law-officers, put an end also to the appointment by Government of K\u0101\u1e93\u012bs. But this seems to have led to inconveniences which were complained of by Mahommedans in some parts of India, and it was enacted in 1880 (Act XII., styled \"The \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012bs Act\") that with reference to any particular locality, and after consultation with the chief Musulman residents therein, the Local Government might select and nominate a \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012b or \u1e32\u0101\u1e93\u012bs for that local area (see FUTWA, LAWOFFICER, MUFTY).\n 1338. -- \"They treated me civilly and set me in front of their mosque during their Easter; at which mosque, on account of its being their Easter, there were assembled from divers quarters a number of their Cadini, i.e. of their bishops.\" -- Letter of Friar Pascal, in Cathay, &c., 235.\n c. 1461.- \"Au tems que Alexandre regna Ung hom, nomm\u00e9 Diomed\u00e8s Devant luy, on luy amena Engrillon\u00e9 poulces et detz Comme ung larron; car il fut des Escumeurs que voyons courir Si fut mys devant le cad\u00e8s, Pour estre jug\u00e9 \u00e0 mourir.\" Gd.

According to Crawfurd this name is unknown to the natives, not only of the great island itself, but of the Archipelago generally, and must have arisen from some Portuguese misunderstanding or corruption. There appears to be no general name for the island in the Malay language, unless Tanah Bugis, 'the Land of the Bugis people' [see BUGIS]. It seems sometimes to have been called the Isle of Macassar. In form Celebes is apparently a Portuguese plural, and several of their early writers speak of Celebes as a group of islands. Crawfurd makes a suggestion, but not very confidently, that Pulo s\u0101labih, 'the islands over and above,' might have been vaguely spoken of by the Malays, and understood by the Portuguese as a name. [Mr. Skeat doubts the correctness of this explanation: \"The standard Malay form would be Pulau S\u0103le\u0306bih, which in some dialects might be S\u0103-le\u0306bis, and this may have been a variant of Si-Le\u0306bih, a man's name, the si corresponding to the def. art. in the Germ. phrase 'der Hans.'

This name, as applied to the great island which hangs from India like a dependent jewel, becomes usual about the 13th century. But it can be traced much earlier. For it appears undoubtedly to be formed from Sinhala or Sihala, 'lions' abode,' the name adopted in the island itself at an early date. This, with the addition of 'Island,' Sihala-dv\u012bpa, comes down to us in Cosmas as *SIELEDI/BA. There was a Pali form Sihalan, which, at an early date, must have been colloquially shortened to Silan, as appears from the old Tamil name Ilam (the Tamil having no proper sibilant), and probably from this was formed the Sarand\u012bp and Sarand\u012bb which was long the name in use by mariners of the Persian Gulf.\n It has been suggested by Mr. Van der Tuuk, that the name Sailan or Silan was really of Javanese origin, as sela (from Skt. \u015bil\u0101, 'a rock, a stone') in Javanese (and in Malay) means 'a precious stone,' hence Pulo Selan would be 'Isle of Gems.' [\"This,\" writes Mr. Skeat, \"is possible, but it remains to be proved that the gem was not named after the island (i.e. 'Ceylon stone'). The full phrase in standard Malay is batu S\u0113lan, where batu means 'stone.' Klinkert merely marks Sailan (Ceylon) as Persian.\"] The island was really called anciently Ratnadv\u012bpa, 'Isle of Gems,' and is termed by an Arab historian of the 9th century Jaz\u012brat-al ya\u1e33\u016bt, 'Isle of Rubies.' So that there is considerable plausibility in Van der Tuuk's suggestion. But the genealogy of the name from Sihala is so legitimate that the utmost that can be conceded is the possibility that the Malay form Selan may have been shaped by the consideration suggested, and may have influenced the general adoption of the form Sail\u0101n, through the predominance of Malay navigation in the Middle Ages.\n c. 362. -- \"Unde nationibus Indicis certatim cum donis optimates mittentibus ante tempus, ab usque Divis et Serendivis.\" -- Ammianus Marcellinus, XXI. vii.\n c. 430. -- \"The island of Lanka was called Sihala after the Lion; listen ye to the narration of the island which I (am going to) tell: 'The daughter of the Vanga King cohabited in the forest with a lion.'\"- Dipavanso, IX. i. 2.\n c. 545. -- \"This is the great island in the ocean, lying in the Indian Sea.

The race inhabiting this portion, Chams or Tsiams, are traditionally said to have occupied the whole breadth of that peninsula to the Gulf of Siam, before the arrival of the Khmer or Kambojan people. It is not clear whether the people in question took their name from Champa, or Champa from the people; but in any case the form of Champa is Sanskrit, and probably it was adopted from India like Kamboja itself and so many other Indo-Chinese names. The original Champ\u0101 was a city and kingdom on the Ganges, near the modern Bh\u0101galpur. And we find the Indo-Chinese Champa in the 7th century called Mah\u0101-champ\u0101, as if to distinguish it. It is probable that the *ZA/BA or *ZA/BAI of Ptolemy represents the name of this ancient kingdom; and it is certainly the Sanf or Chanf of the Arab navigators 600 years later; this form representing Champ as nearly as is possible to the Arabic alphabet.\n c. A.D. 640. -- \". . . plus loin \u00e0 l'est, le royaume de Mo-ho-tchen-po\" (Mah\u0101champ\u0101). -- Hiouen Thsang, in P\u00e8lerins Bouddh. iii. 83.\n 851. -- \"Ships then proceed to the place called Sanf (or Chanf) . . . there fresh water is procured; from this place is exported the aloes-wood called Chanfi.

The earliest occurrence of the word that we know is in Father Beschi's Tamil story of Parmartta Guru (c. 1725). On p. 1 one of the characters is described as carrying a firebrand to light his pugaiyailai shshuru\u1e6d\u1e6du, 'roll (cheroot) of tobacco.' [The N.E.D. quotes cheroota in 1669.] Grose (1750-60), speaking of Bombay, whilst describing the cheroot does not use that word, but another which is, as far as we know, entirely obsolete in British India, viz.

The name of an imaginary lake, which in the maps of the 16th century, followed by most of those of the 17th, is made the source of most of the great rivers of Further India, including the Brahmaputra, the Irawadi, the Salwen, and the Menam. Lake Chiamay was the counterpart of the African lake of the same period which is made the source of all the great rivers of Africa, but it is less easy to suggest what gave rise to this idea of it. The actual name seems taken from the State of Zimm\u00e9 (see JANGOMAY) or Chiang-mai.\n c. 1544. -- \"So proceeding onward, he arrived at the Lake of Singipamor, which ordinarily is called Chiammay. . . .\" -- F.

Heylin's Cosmographie, ii. 238.\n", "chicane": "ss. These English words, signifying pettifogging, captious contention, taking every possible advantage in a contest, have been referred to Spanish chico, 'little,' and to Fr. chic, chicquet, 'a little bit,' as by Mr. Wedgwood in his Dict. of Eng. Etymology. See also quotation from Saturday Review below. But there can be little doubt that the words are really traceable to the game of chaug\u0101n, or horse-golf. This game is now well known in England under the name of Polo (q.v.). But the recent introduction under that name is its second importation into Western Europe. For in the Middle Ages it came from Persia to Byzantium, where it was popular under a modification of its Persian name (verb TZUKANI/ZEIN, playing ground TZUKANISTH/RION), and from Byzantium it passed, as a pedestrian game, to Languedoc, where it was called, by a further modification, chicane (see Ducange, Dissertations sur l'Histoire de St. Louis, viii., and his Glossarium Graecitatis, s.v. TZUKANI/ZEIN; also Ouseley's Travels, i. 345). The analogy of certain periods of the game of golf suggests how the figurative meaning of chicaner might arise in taking advantage of the petty accidents of the surface. And this is the strict meaning of chicaner, as used by military writers.\n Ducange's idea was that the Greeks had borrowed both the game and the name from France, but this is evidently erroneous. He was not aware of the Persian chaug\u0101n. But he explains well how the tactics of the game would have led to the application of its name to \"those tortuous proceedings of pleaders which we old practitioners call barres.\" The indication of the Persian origin of both the Greek and French words is due to W. Ouseley and to Quatrem\u00e8re. The latter has an interesting note, full of his usual wealth of Oriental reading, in his translation of Makrizi's Mameluke Sultans, tom. i. pt. i. pp. 121 seqq.\n The preceding etymology was put forward again in Notes upon Mr. Wedgwood's Dictionary published by one of the present writers in Ocean Highways, Sept. 1872, p. 186. The same etymology has since been given by Littr\u00e9 (s.v.), who says: \"D\u00e8s lors, la s\u00e9rie des sens est: jeu de mail, puis action de disputer la partie, et enfin man\u0153uvres processives\"; [and is accepted by the N.E.D. with the reservation that \"evidence actually connecting the French with the Greek word appears not to be known\"].\n The P. forms of the name are chaug\u0101n and chauig\u0101n; but according to the Bah\u0101ri 'Ajam (a great Persian dictionary compiled in India, 1768) the primitive form of the word is chulg\u0101n from ch\u016bl, 'bent,' which (as to the form) is corroborated by the Arabic sawlj\u0101n. On the other hand, a probable origin of chaug\u0101n would be an Indian (Prakrit) word, meaning 'four corners' [Platts gives chaug\u0101na, 'four-fold'], viz. as a name for the polo-ground. The chulg\u0101n is possibly a 'striving after meaning.' The meanings are according to V\u00fcllers (1) any stick with a crook; (2) such a stick used as a drumstick; (3) a crook from which a steel ball is suspended, which was one of the royal insignia, otherwise called kaukaba [see Blochmann, \u0100\u012bn, vol. i. plate ix. No. 2.]; (4) (The golf-stick, and) the game of horse-golf.\n The game is now quite extinct in Persia and Western Asia, surviving only in certain regions adjoining India, as is specified under Polo. But for many centuries it was the game of kings and courts over all Mahommedan Asia. The earliest Mahommedan historians represent the game of chaug\u0101n as familiar to the Sassanian kings; Ferdusi puts the chaug\u0101n-stick into the hands of Si\u0101w\u016bsh, the father of Kai Khusr\u016b or Cyrus; many famous kings were devoted to the game, among whom may be mentioned N\u016brudd\u012bn the Just, At\u0101bek of Syria and the great enemy of the Crusaders. He was so fond of the game that he used (like Akbar in after days) to play it by lamp-light, and was severely rebuked by a devout Mussulman for being so devoted to a mere amusement. Other zealous chaug\u0101n-players were the great Saladin, Jal\u0101ludd\u012bn Mankbarni of Khw\u0101rizm, and Malik B\u012bbars, Marco Polo's \"Bendocquedar Soldan of Babylon,\" who was said more than once to have played chaug\u0101n at Damascus and at Cairo within the same week. Many illustrious persons also are mentioned in Asiatic history as having met their death by accidents in the maid\u0101n, as the chaug\u0101n-field was especially called; e.g. Kutbudd\u012bn Ibak of Delhi, who was killed by such a fall at Lahore in (or about) 1207. In Makrizi (I. i. 121) we read of an Am\u012br at the Mameluke Court called Hus\u0101mudd\u012bn Laj\u012bn 'Az\u012bz\u012b the Juk\u0101nd\u0101r (or Lord High Polo-stick).\n It is not known when the game was conveyed to Constantinople, but it must have been not later than the beginning of the 8th century.* The fullest description of the game as played there is given by Johannes Cinnamus (c. 1190), who does not however give the barbarian name:\n \"The winter now being over and the gloom cleared away, he (the Emperor Manuel Comnenus) devoted himself to a certain sober exercise which from the first had been the custom of the Emperors and their sons to practise. This is the manner thereof. A party of young men divide into two equal bands, and in a flat space which has been The court for chaug\u0101n is ascribed by Codinus (see below) to Theodosius Parvus. This could hardly be the son of Arcadius (A.D. 408-450), but rather Theodosius III. (716-718).\n measured out purposely they cast a leather ball in size somewhat like an apple; and setting this in the middle as if it were a prize to be contended for they rush into the contest at full speed, each grasping in his right hand a stick of moderate length which comes suddenly to a broad rounded end, the middle of which is closed by a network of dried catgut. Then each party strives who shall first send the ball beyond the goal planted conspicuously on the opposite side, for whenever the ball is struck by the netted sticks through the goal at either side, that gives the victory to the other side. This is the kind of game, evidently a slippery and dangerous one. For a player must be continually throwing himself right back, or bending to one side or the other, as he turns his horse short, or suddenly dashes off at speed, with such strokes and twists as are needed to follow up the ball. . . . And thus as the Emperor was rushing round in furious fashion in this game, it so happened that the horse which he rode came violently to the ground. He was prostrate below the horse, and as he struggled vainly to extricate himself from its incumbent weight his thigh and hand were crushed beneath the saddle and much injured. . . .\" -- In Bonn ed. pp. 263-264.\n We see from this passage that at Byzantium the game was played with a kind of racket, and not with a polostick. \n We have not been able to find an instance of the medieval French chicane in this sense, nor does Littr\u00e9's Dictionary give any. But Ducange states positively that in his time the word in this sense survived in Languedoc, and there could be no better evidence. From Henschel's Ducange also we borrow a quotation which shows chuca, used for some game of ball, in French-Latin, surely a form of chaug\u0101n or chicane.\n The game of chaug\u0101n, the ball (g\u016b or gav\u012b) and the playing-ground (maid\u0101n) afford constant metaphors in Persian literature.\n c. 820. -- \"If a man dream that he is on horseback along with the King himself, or some great personage, and that he strikes the ball home, or wins the chuk\u0101n (H)/TOI TZUKANI/ZEI) he shall find grace and favour thereupon, conformable to the success of his ball and the dexterity of his horse.\" Again: \"If the King dream that he has won in the chuk\u0101n (O(/TI E)TZUKANI/ZEN) he shall find things prosper with him.\" -- The Dream Judgments of Achmet Ibn Seirim, from a MS.

This is the Venetian zecchino, cecchino, or sequin, a gold coin long current on the shores of India, and which still frequently turns up in treasure-trove, and in hoards. In the early part of the 15th century Nicolo Conti mentions that in some parts of India, Venetian ducats, i.e. sequins, were current (p. 30). And recently, in fact in our own day, chick was a term in frequent Anglo-Indian use, e.g. \"I'll bet you a chick.\"\n The word zecchino is from the Zecca, or Mint at Venice, and that name is of Arabic origin, from sikka, 'a coining die.' The double history of this word is curious. We have just seen how in one form, and by what circuitous secular journey, through Egypt, Venice, India, it has gained a place in the Anglo-Indian Vocabulary. By a directer route it has also found a distinct place in the same repository under the form Sicca (q.v.), and in this shape it still retains a ghostly kind of existence at the India Office. It is remarkable how first the spread of Saracenic power and civilisation, then the spread of Venetian commerce and coinage, and lastly the spread of English commerce and power, should thus have brought together two words identical in origin, after so widely divergent a career.\n The sequin is sometimes called in the South sh\u0101n\u0101rcash, because the Doge with his sceptre is taken for the Sh\u0101n\u0101r, or toddy-drawer climbing the palm-tree!

Embroidery; Chickenwalla , an itinerant dealer in embroidered handkerchiefs, petticoats, and such like. P. chikin or chik\u012bn, 'art needlework.' [At Lucknow, the chief centre of the manufacture, this embroidery was formerly done in silk; the term is now applied to handworked flowered muslin. (See Hoey, Monograph, 88, Yusuf Ali, 69.)]\n", "chickore": "s. The red-legged partridge, or its close congener Caccabis chukor, Gray. It is common in the Western Him\u0101laya, in the N. Punjab, and in Afghanistan. The francolin of Moorcroft's Travels is really the chickore. The name appears to be Skt. chakora, and this disposes of the derivation formerly suggested by one of the present writers, as from the Mongol tsokhor, 'dappled or pied' (a word, moreover, which the late Prof. Schiefner informed us is only applied to horses). The name is sometimes applied to other birds. Thus, according to Cunningham, it is applied in Ladak to the Snow-cock (Tetraogallus Himalayensis, Gray), and he appears to give ch\u00e1-kor as meaning 'white-bird' in Tibetan. Jerdon gives 'snow chukor' and 'strath-chukor' as sportsmen's names for this fine bird. And in Bengal Proper the name is applied, by local English sportsmen, to the large handsome partridge (Ortygornis gularis, Tem.) of Eastern Bengal, called in H. kaiyah or ban-t\u012btar ('forest partridge'). See Jerdon, ed. 1877, ii. 575. Also the birds described in the extract from Mr. Abbott below do not appear to have been caccabis (which he speaks of in the same journal as 'redlegged partridge'). And the use of the word by Persians (apparently) is notable; it does not appear in Persian dictionaries. There is probably some mistake. The birds spoken of may have been the Large Sand-grouse (Pterocles arenarius, Pal.), which in both Persia and Afghanistan is called by names meaning 'Black-breast.'\n The belief that the chickore eats fire, mentioned in the quotation below, is probably from some verbal misconception (quasi \u0101tish-kho\u0304r?). [This is hardly probable as the idea that the partridge drinks the moonbeams is as old as the Brahma Vaivarta Pur\u0101na: \"O Lord, I drink in with the partridges of my eyes thy face full of nectar, which resembles the full moon of autumn.\" Also see Katha Sarit S\u0101gara, tr. by Mr. Tawney (ii. 243), who has kindly given the above references.] Jerdon states that the Afghans call the bird the 'Fire-eater.'\n c. 1190. -- \". . . plantains and fruits, Koils, Chakors, peacocks, Sarases, beautiful to behold. \" -- The Prithir\u00e1ja R\u00e1san of Chand Bard\u00e1\u012b, in Ind.

The popular Anglo-Indian name of the pod of red pepper (Capsicum fruticosum and C. annuum, Nat. Ord. Solanaceae).

In the sense of porcelain this word (Ch\u012bn\u012b, &c.) is used in Asiatic languages as well as in English. In English it does not occur in Minshew (2nd ed. 1627), though it does in some earlier publications. [The earliest quotation in N.E.D. is from Cogan's Pinto, 1653.] The phrase China-dishes as occurring in Drake and in Shakspere, shows how the word took the sense of porcelain in our own and other languages. The phrase China-dishes as first used was analogous to Turkeycarpets.  But in the latter we have never lost the geographical sense of the adjective. In the word turquoises, again, the phrase was no doubt originally pierres turquoises, or the like, and here, as in china dishes, the specific has superseded the generic sense. The use of arab in India for an Arab horse is analogous to china.

A name sometimes given by the natives to Madras. The name is now written Shennai-Shenna-ppatanam, Tam., in Tel. Chennapattanamu, and the following is the origin of that name according to the statement given in W. Hamilton's Hindostan.\n On \"this part of the Coast of Coromandel . . . the English . . . possessed no fixed establishment until A.D. 1639, in which year, on the 1st of March, a grant was received from the descendants of the Hindoo dynasty of Bijanagur, then reigning at Chandergherry, for the erection of a fort. This document from Sree Rung Rayeel expressly enjoins, that the town and fort to be erected at Madras shall be called after his own name, Sree Runga Rayapatam; but the local governor or Naik, Damerla Vencatadri, who first invited Mr. Francis Day, the chief of Armagon, to remove to Madras, had previously intimated to him that he would have the new English establishment founded in the name of his father Chennappa, and the name of Chenappapatam continues to be universally applied to the town of Madras by the natives of that division of the south of India named Dravida.\" -- (Vol. ii. p. 413).\n Dr. Burnell doubted this origin of the name, and considered that the actual name could hardly have been formed from that of Chenappa. It is possible that some name similar to Chinapatan was borne by the place previously. It will be seen under MADRAS that Barros curiously connects the Chinese with St. Thom\u00e9. To this may be added this passage from the English translation of Mendoza's China, the original of which was published in 1585, the translation by R. Parke in 1588:-\n \". . . it is plainely seene that they did come with the shipping vnto the Indies . . . so that at this day there is great memory of them in the Ilands Philippinas and on the cost of Coromande, which is the cost against the Kingdome of Norsinga towards the sea of Bengala (misprinted Cengala); whereas is a town called vnto this day the Soile of the Chinos for that they did reedifie and make the same\" -- (i. 94).\n I strongly suspect that this was Chinapatam, or Madras. [On the other hand, the popular derivation is accepted in the Madras Gloss., p. 163. The gold plate containing the grant of Sri Ranga R\u0101ja is said to have been kept by the English for more than a century, till its loss in 1746 at the capture of Madras by the French.- (Wheeler, Early Rec., 49).]\n 1780. -- \"The Nawaub sent him to Cheena Pattun (Madras) under the escort of a small party of light Cavalry.\" -- H. of Hydur Naik, 395.\n", "chinchew": "n.p. A port of Fuhkien in China. Some ambiguity exists as to the application of the name. In English charts the name is now attached to the ancient and famous port of Chwan-chau-fu (Thsiouan-ch\u00e9ou-fou of French writers), the Zayton of Marco Polo and other medieval travellers. But the Chincheo of the Spaniards and Portuguese to this day, and the Chinchew of older English books, is, as Mr. G. Phillips pointed out some years ago, not Chwanchau-fu, but Chang-chau-fu, distant from the former some 80 m. in a direct line, and about 140 by navigation. The province of Fuhkien is often called Chincheo by the early Jesuit writers. Changchau and its dependencies seem to have constituted the ports of Fuhkien with which Macao and Manilla communicated, and hence apparently they applied the same name to the port and the province, though Chang-chau was never the official capital of Fukhien (see Encyc. Britann., 9th ed. s.v. and refer ences there). Chincheos is used for \"people of Fuhkien\" in a quotation under COMPOUND.\n 1517. -- \". . . in another place called Chincheo, where the people were much richer than in Canton (Canta\u0303o).

In the \"pigeon English\" of Chinese ports this signifies 'salutation, compliments,' or 'to salute,' and is much used by Englishmen as slang in such senses. It is a corruption of the Chinese phrase ts'ingts'ing, Pekingese ch'ing-ch'ing, a term of salutation answering to 'thank-you,' 'adieu.' In the same vulgar dialect chin-chin joss means religious worship of any kind (see JOSS). It is curious that the phrase occurs in a quaint story told to William of Rubruck by a Chinese priest whom he met at the Court of the Great Kaan (see below). And it is equally remarkable to find the same story related with singular closeness of correspondence out of \"the Chinese books of Geography\" by Francesco Carletti, 350 years later (in 1600). He calls the creatures Zinzin (Ragionamenti di F. C., pp. 138-9).\n 1253. -- \"One day there sate by me a certain priest of Cathay, dressed in a red cloth of exquisite colour, and when I asked him whence they got such a dye, he told me how in the eastern parts of Cathay there were lofty cliffs on which dwelt certain creatures in all things partaking of human form, except that their knees did not bend. . . . The huntsmen go thither, taking very strong beer with them, and make holes in the rocks which they fill with this beer. . . . Then they hide themselves and these creatures come out of their holes and taste the liquor, and call out 'Chin Chin.'\" -- Itinerarium, in Rec. de Voyages, &c., iv. 328.\n Probably some form of this phrase is intended in the word used by Pinto in the following passage, which Cogan leaves untranslated:-\n c. 1540. -- \"So after we had saluted one another after the manner of the Country, they went and anchored by the shore\" (in orig. \"despois de se fazerem as suas e as nossas salvas a Charachina como entre este gente se custuma.\") -- In Cogan, p. 56; in orig. ch. xlvii.\n 1795. -- \"The two junior members of the Chinese deputation came at the appointed hour. . . .

It is a corruption of the Portuguese chinche, which again is from cimex. Mrs. Trollope, in her once famous book on the Domestic Manners of the Americans, made much of a supposed instance of affected squeamishness in American ladies, who used the word chintses instead of bugs. But she was ignorant of the fact that chints was an old and proper name for the objectionable exotic insect, 'bug' being originally but a figurative (and perhaps a polite) term, 'an object of disgust and horror' (Wedgwood). Thus the case was exactly the opposite of what she chose to imagine; chints was the real name, bug the more or less affected euphonism.\n 1616. -- \"In the night we were likewise very much disquieted with another sort, called Musqueetoes, like our Gnats, but some-what less; and in that season we were very much troubled with Chinches, another sort of little troublesome and offensive creatures, like little Tikes: and these annoyed us two wayes; as first by their biting and stinging, and then by their stink.\" -- Terry, ed. 1665, p. 372; [ed. 1777, p. 117].\n 1645. -- \". . . for the most part the bedsteads in Italy are of forged iron gilded, since it is impossible to keepe the wooden ones from the chimices.\" -- Evelyn's Diary, Sept. 29.\n 1673. -- \". . .

It comes apparently from the Skt. chitra, 'variegated, speckled.' The best chintzes were bought on the Madras coast, at Masulipatam and Sadras. The French form of the word is chite, which has suggested the possibility of our sheet being of the same origin. But chite is apparently of Indian origin, through the Portuguese, whilst sheet is much older than the Portuguese communication with India. Thus (1450) in Sir T. Cumberworth's will he directs his \"wreched body to be beryd in a chitte with owte any kyste\" (Academy, Sept. 27, 1879, p. 230).

See the phraseology in the quotation from Wheeler above.\n This export from India to Europe has long ceased. When one of the present writers was Sub-Collector of the Madras District (1866-67), chintzes were still figured by an old man at Sadras, who had been taught by the Dutch, the cambric being furnished to him by a Madras Chetty (q.v.). He is now dead, and the business has ceased; in fact the colours for the process are no longer to be had.* The former chintz manufactures of Pulicat are mentioned by Correa, Lendas, ii. 2, p. 567. Havart (1693) mentions the manufacture at Sadras (i. 92), and gives a good description of the process of painting these cloths, which he calls chitsen (iii. 13). There is also a very complete account in the Lettres \u00c9difiantes, xiv. 116 seqq.\n In Java and Sumatra chintzes of a very peculiar kind of marbled pattern are still manufactured by women, under the name of b\u0101tik.\n", "chipe": "s.

But though limited to a specific locality, of which I doubt not it was true, it conveys an idea of the entire extinction of the ancient chintz production which I find is not justified by the facts, as shown in a most interesting letter from Mr. Purdon Clarke, C.S.I., of the India Museum. One kind is still made at Masulipatam, under the superintendence of Persian merchants, to supply the Ispahan market and the \"Moghul\" traders at Bombay. At Pulicat very peculiar chintzes are made, which are entirely \u1e32alam K\u0101r\u012b work, or hand-painted (apparently the word now used instead of the Calmend\u0101r of Tavernier, -- see above, and under CALAMANDER). This is a work of infinite labour, as the ground has to be stopped off with wax almost as many times as there are colours used. At Combaconum Sarongs (q.v.) are printed for the Straits. Very bold printing is done at W\u0101l\u0101j\u0101pet in N. Arcot, for sale to the Moslem at Hyderabad and Bangalore.\n An anecdote is told me by Mr. Clarke which indicates a caution as to more things than chintz printing. One particular kind of chintz met with in S. India, he was assured by the vendor, was printed at W --- ; but he did not recognize the locality.

The Disease. The term 'cholera,' though employed by the old medical writers, no doubt came, as regards its familiar use, from India. Littr\u00e9 alleges that it is a mistake to suppose that the word cholera (XOLE/RA) is a derivative from XOLH/, 'bile,' and that it really means 'a gutter,' the disease being so called from the symptoms. This should, however, rather be A)PO\\ TW=N XOLA/DWN, the latter word being anciently used for the intestines (the etym. given by the medical writer, Alex. Trallianus). But there is a discussion on the subject in the modern ed. of Stephani Thesaurus, which indicates a conclusion that the derivation from XOLH\\ is probably right; it is that of Celsus (see below).

Properly a seal-impression, stamp, or brand; H. chh\u0103p; the verb (chh\u0101pn\u0101) being that which is now used in Hindustani to express the art of printing (books).\n The word chh\u0101p seems not to have been traced back with any accuracy beyond the modern vernaculars. It has been thought possible (at least till the history should be more accurately traced) that it might be of Portuguese origin. For there is a Port. word chapa, 'a thin plate of metal,' which is no doubt the original of the Old English chape for the metal plate on the sheath of a sword or dagger.* The word in this sense is not in the Portuguese Dictionaries; but we find 'homem chapado, ' explained as 'a man of notable worth or excellence,' and Bluteau considers this a metaphor 'taken from the chapas or plates of metal on which the kings of India caused their letters patent to be engraven. ' Thus he would seem to have regarded, though perhaps erroneously, the chh\u0101p\u0101 and the Portuguese chapa as identical. On the other hand, Mr. Beames entertains no doubt that the word is genuine Hindi, and connects it with a variety of other words signifying striking, or pressing. And Thompson in his Hindi Dictionary says that chh\u0101pp\u0101 is a technical term used by the Vaishnavas to denote the sectarial marks (lotus, trident, &c.), which they delineate on their bodies. Fallon gives the same meaning, and quotes a Hindi verse, using it in this sense. We may add that while chh\u0101p\u0101 is used all over the N.W.P. and Punjab for printed cloths, Drummond (1808) gives chh\u0101p\u0101n\u012bya, chhap\u0101r\u0101, as words for 'Stampers or Printers of Cloth' in Guzerati, and that the passage quoted below from a Treaty made with an ambassador from Guzerat by the Portuguese in 1537, uses the word chapada for struck or coined, exactly as the modern Hindi verb chh\u0101pn\u0101 might be used.\u2020 Chop, in writers Thus, in Shakspeare, \"This is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist . . . that had the whole theorie of war in the knot of his scarf, the practice in the chape of his dagger.\" -- All's Well that Ends Well, iv. 3. And, in the Scottish Rates and Valuatiouns, under 1612:\n \"Lockattis and Chapes for daggers.\"\n \". . . e quanto \u00e1 moeda, ser ehapada de sua sica (by error printed sita), pois j\u00e1 lhe concedea, que todo o proveyto serya del Rey de Portuguall, como soya a ser dos Reis dos Guzarates, e ysto nas terras que nos tiuermos em Canbaya, e a nos quisermos bater.\" -- Treaty (1537) in S. Botelho, Tombo, 226.\n prior to the last century, is often used for the seal itself. \"Owen Cambridge says the Mohr was the great seal, but the small or privy seal was called a 'chop' or 'stamp.'\" (C. P. Brown).\n The word chop is hardly used now among Anglo-Indians in the sense of seal or stamp. But it got a permanent footing in the 'Pigeon English' of the Chinese ports, and thence has come back to England and India, in the phrase \"first-chop,\" i.e. of the first brand or quality.\n The word chop (ch\u0101p) is adopted in Malay [with the meanings of seal-impression, stamp, to seal or stamp, though there is, as Mr. Skeat points out, a pure native word tera or tra, which is used in all these senses;] and chop has acquired the specific sense of a passport or licence. The word has also obtained a variety of applications, including that just mentioned, in the lingua franca of foreigners in the China seas. Van Braam applies it to a tablet bearing the Emperor's name, to which he and his fellow envoys made kotow on their first landing in China (Voyage, &c., Paris, An vi., 1798, i. 20-21). Again, in the same jargon, a chop of tea means a certain number of chests of tea, all bearing the same brand. Chop -- houses are customs stations on the Canton River, so called from the chops, or seals, used there (Giles, Glossary). Chop-dollar is a dollar chopped, or stamped with a private mark, as a guarantee of its genuineness (ibid.). (Dollars similarly marked had currency in England in the first quarter of last century, and one of the present writers can recollect their occasional occurrence in Scotland in his childhood). The grand chop is the port clearance granted by the Chinese customs when all dues have been paid (ibid.). All these have obviously the same origin; but there are other uses of the word in China not so easily explained, e.g. chop, for 'a hulk'; chop-boat for a lighter or cargoboat. \n In Captain Forrest's work, quoted below, a golden badge or decoration, conferred on him by the King of Achin, is called a chapp (p. 55). The portrait of Forrest, engraved by Sharp, shows this badge, and gives the inscription, translated: \"Capt. Thomas Forrest, Orancayo [see ORANKAY] of the Golden Sword. This chapp was conferred as a mark of honour in the city of Atcheen, belonging to the Faithful, by the hands of the Shabander [see SHAHBUNDER] of Atcheen, on Capt.

It may be fairly conjectured that the true reading of this was *TII/MOULA, or *TIE/MOULA. We find the sound ch of Indian names apparently represented in Ptolemy by TI (as it is in Dutch by tj). Thus *TIA/TOURA=Chitor, *TIA/STANHS= Chash\u1e6da\u1e47a; here *TI/MOULA=Che\u1e45wal; while *TIA/GOURA and *TIAU/SPA probably stand for names like Chagara and Chauspa.

There were memorable sieges of Choul in 1570-71, and again in 1594, in which the Portuguese successfully resisted Mahommedan attempts to capture the place. Dr. Burgess identifies the ancient *SH/MULLA rather with a place called Chembur, on the island of Trombay, which lies immediately east of the island of Bombay; but till more evidence is adduced we see no reason to adopt this.* Choul seems now to be known as Revada\u1e47\u1e0da.

Gifford's upon the passage in Ben Jonson's Alchemist, which is quoted below. \"In 1609 Sir Robert Shirley sent a messenger or chiaus (as our old writers call him) to this country, as his agent, from the Grand Signor and the Sophy, to transact some preparatory business. Sir Robert followed him, at his leisure, as ambassador from both these princes; but before he reached England, his agent had chiaused the Turkish and Persian merchants here of 4000l., and taken his flight, unconscious perhaps that he had enriched the language with a word of which the etymology would mislead Upton and puzzle Dr. Johnson.\" -- Ed. of Ben Jonson, iv. 27. \"In Kattywar, where the native chiefs employ Arab mercenaries, the Chaus still flourishes as an officer of a company.

One of the above quotations proves his accuracy as to 1618. Perhaps, however, the particular fraud had little to do with the modern use of the word. As Jonson suggests, chiaus may have been used for 'Turk' in the sense of 'cheat'; just as Cataian stood for 'thief' or 'rogue.'

The Yak-tails and their uses are mentioned by Aelian, and by Cosmas (see under YAK).

These names were relics of the original commercial character of the E. I. Company's transactions, and had long ceased to have any practical meaning at the time of their abolition in 1833, when the Charter Act (3 & 4 Will. IV. c. 85), removed the last traces of the Company's commercial existence.\n 1848. -- (Lady O'Dowd's) \"quarrel with Lady Smith, wife of Minos Smith the puisne Judge, is still remembered by some at Madras, when the Colonel's lady snapped her fingers in the Judge's lady's face, and said she'd never walk behind ever a beggarly civilian.\" -- Vanity Fair, ed. 1867, ii. 85.\n 1872. -- \"You bloated civilians are never satisfied, retorted the other.\" -- A TrueReformer, i. 4.\n", "classy": "s.

Khal\u0101\u1e63 is constantly used in Hindustani in the sense of 'liberation'; thus, of a prisoner, a magistrate says 'khal\u0101\u1e63 karo,' 'let him go.' But it is not clear how khal\u0101\u1e63\u012b got its ordinary Indian sense. It is also written khal\u0101sh\u012b, and Vullers has an old Pers. word khal\u0101sha for 'a ship's rudder.' A learned friend suggests that this may be the real origin of khal\u0101\u1e63\u012b in its Indian use. [Khal\u0101\u1e63 also means the 'escape channel of a canal,' and khal\u0101s\u012b may have been originally a person in charge of such a work.]\n 1785. -- \"A hundred clashies have been sent to you from the presence.\" -- Tippoo's Letters, 171.\n 1801. -- \"The sepoys in a body were to bring up the rear.

The modern English name of this spice is a kind of ellipsis from the French clous de girofles, 'Nails of Girofles,' i.e. of garofala, caryophylla, &c., the name by which this spice was known to the ancients; the full old English name was similar, 'clove gillofloure, ' a name which, cut in two like a polypus, has formed two different creatures, the clove (or nail) being assigned to the spice, and the 'gillyflower' to a familiar clove-smelling flower. The comparison to nails runs through many languages.

It is hard, however, to conceive how this name should have survived, to reappear in Europe in the later Middle Ages, without being known in any intermediate literature.*\n The more common etymology is that which is given by Barros, Garcia de Orta, Linschoten, &c., as from a Spanish word coco applied to a monkey's or other grotesque face, with reference to the appearance of the base of the shell with its three holes. But after all may the term not have origin It may be noted that Theophrastus describes under the names of KU/KAS and KO/I+C a palm of Ethiopia, which was perhaps the Doom palm of Upper Egypt (Theoph. H. P. ii. 6, 10). Schneider, the editor of Theoph., states that Sprengel identified this with the coco-palm. See the quotation from Pliny below.\n ated in the old Span. coca, 'a shell' (presumably Lat. concha), which we have also in French coque? properly an egg-shell, but used also for the shell of any nut. (See a remark under COPRAH.)\n The Skt. narikila [n\u0101rikera, n\u0101rikela] has originated the Pers. n\u0101rg\u012bl, which Cosmas grecizes into A)RGELLI/ON, [and H. n\u0101riyal].\n Medieval writers generally (such as Marco Polo, Fr. Jordanus, &c.) call the fruit the Indian Nut, the name by which it was known to the Arabs (al jauz-al-Hind\u012b). There is no evidence of its having been known to classical writers, nor are we aware of any Greek or Latin mention of it before Cosmas. But Brugsch, describing from the Egyptian wall-paintings of c. B.C. 1600, on the temple of Queen Hashop, representing the expeditions by sea which she sent to the Incense Land of Punt, says: \"Men never seen before, the inhabitants of this divine land, showed themselves on the coast, not less astonished than the Egyptians. They lived on pile-buildings, in little dome-shaped huts, the entrance to which was effected by a ladder, under the shade of cocoa-palms laden with fruit, and splendid incense-trees, on whose boughs strange fowls rocked themselves, and at whose feet herds of cattle peacefully reposed.\" (H. of Egypt, 2nd ed. i. 353; [Maspero, Struggle of the Nations, 248].)\n c. A.D. 70. -- \"In ipsa\u0302 quidem Aethiopia\u0302 fricatur haec, tanta est siccitas, et farinae modo spissatur in panem.

The fruit is that which we call nuts of India.\"- Friar Jordanus, 15 seq. The wonder of the coco-palm is so often noticed in this form by medieval writers, that doubtless in their minds they referred it to that \"tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruit, and yielded her fruit every month\" (Apocal. xxii. 2).\n c. 1340. -- \"Le narg\u012bl, appel\u00e9 autrement noix d'Inde, auquel on ne peut comparer aucun autre fruit, est vert et rempli d'huile.\" -- Shih\u0101bbudd\u012bn Dimish\u1e33\u012b, in Not. et Exts. xiii. 175.\n c. 1350. -- \"Wonderful fruits there are, which we never see in these parts, such as the Nargil.

VALERE.\" Sat. Review, Sept. 10, p. 326.\n The Dict. Hist. d'Argot of Lor\u00e9dan Larchey, from which this seems taken, explains picton as 'vin sup\u00e9rieur.'\n", "coco-de-mer": "or DOUBLE COCO-NUT , s. The curious twin fruit so called, the produce of the Lodoicea Sechellarum, a palm growing only in the Seychelles Islands, is cast up on the shores of the Indian Ocean, most frequently on the Maldive Islands, but occasionally also on Ceylon and S. India, and on the coasts of Zanzibar, of Sumatra, and some others of the Malay Islands. Great virtues as medicine and antidote were supposed to reside in these fruits, and extravagant prices were paid for them. The story goes that a \"country captain,\" expecting to make his fortune, took a cargo of these nuts from the Seychelles Islands to Calcutta, but the only result was to destroy their value for the future.\n The old belief was that the fruit was produced on a palm growing below the sea, whose fronds, according to Malay seamen, were sometimes seen in quiet bights on the Sumatran coast, especially in the Lampong Bay. According to one form of the story among the Malays, which is told both by Pigafetta and by Rumphius, there was but one such tree, the fronds of which rose above an abyss of the Southern Ocean, and were the abode of the monstrous bird Garuda (or Rukh of the Arabs -- see ROC).* The tree itself was called Pausengi, which Rumphius seems to interpret as a corruption of Buwa-zangi, \"Fruit of Zang\" or E. Africa. [Mr. Skeat writes: \"Rumphius is evidently wrong. . . . The first part of the word is 'Pau,' or 'Pauh,' which is perfectly good Malay, and is the name given to various species of mango, especially the wild one, so that 'Pausengi' represents (not 'Buwa,' but) 'Pauh Janggi,' which is to this day the universal Malay name for the tree which grows, according to Malay fable, in the central whirlpool or Navel of the Seas. Some versions add that it grows upon a sunken bank (te\u0306bing runtoh), and is guarded by dragons. This tree figures largely in Malay romances, especially those which form the subject of Malay shadow-plays (vide infra, Pl. 23, for an illustration of the Pauh Janggi and the Crab). Rumphius' explanation of the second part of the name (i.e. Janggi) is, no doubt, quite correct.\" -- Malay Magic, pp. 6 seqq.).] They were cast up occasionally on the islands off the S.W. coast of Sumatra; and the wild people of the islands brought them for sale to the Sumatran marts, such as Padang and Priamang. One of the largest (say about 12 inches across) would sell for 150-rix dollars. But the Malay princes coveted them This mythical story of the unique tree producing this nut curiously shadows the singular fact that one island only (Praslin) of that secluded group, the Seychelles, bears the Lodoicea as an indigenous and spontaneous product. (See Sir L. Pelly, in J.R.G.S., xxxv. 232.)\n greatly, and would sometimes (it was alleged) give a laden junk for a single nut. In India the best known source of supply was from the Maldive Islands. [In India it is known as Dary\u0101\u012b n\u0101riyal, or 'cocoa-nut of the sea,' and this term has been in Bombay corrupted into jahar\u012b (zahr\u012b) or 'poisonous,' so that the fruit is incorrectly regarded as dangerous to life. The hard shell is largely used to make Fak\u012brs' water-bowls.]\n The medicinal virtues of the nut were not only famous among all the peoples of the East, including the Chinese, but are extolled by Piso and by Rumphius, with many details. The latter, learned and laborious student of nature as he was, believed in the submarine origin of the nut, though he discredited its growing on a great palm, as no traces of such a plant had ever been discovered on the coasts. The fame of the nut's virtues had extended to Europe, and the Emperor Rudolf II. in his later days offered in vain 4000 florins to purchase from the family of Wolfert Hermanszen, a Dutch Admiral, one that had been presented to that commander by the King of Bantam, on the Hollander's relieving his capital, attacked by the Portuguese, in 1602.\n It will be seen that the Maldive name of this fruit was T\u0101va-k\u0101rh\u012b. The latter word is 'coco-nut,' but the meaning of t\u0101va does not appear from any Maldive vocabulary. [The term is properly T\u0101va'karhi, 'the hard-shelled nut,' (Gray, on Pyrard de Laval, Hak. Soc. i. 231).] Rumphius states that a book in 4to (totum opusculum) was published on this nut, at Amsterdam in 1634, by Augerius Clutius, M.D. [In more recent times the nut has become famous as the subject of curious speculations regarding it by the late Gen. Gordon.]\n 1522. -- \"They also related to us that beyond Java Major . . . there is an enormous tree named Campanganghi, in which dwell certain birds named Garuda, so large that they take with their claws, and carry away flying, a buffalo and even an elephant, to the place of the tree. . . . The fruit of this tree is called Buapanganghi, and is larger than a water-melon . . . it was understood that those fruits which are frequently found in the sea came from that place.\" -- Pigafetta, Hak. Soc. p. 155.\n 1553. -- \". . . it appears . . . that in some places beneath the salt-water there grows another kind of these trees, which gives a fruit bigger than the coco-nut; and experience shows that the inner husk of this is much more efficacious against poison than the Bezoar stone.\" -- Barros, III. iii. 7.\n 1563. -- \"The common story is that those islands were formerly part of the continent, but being low they were submerged, whilst these palm - trees continued in situ; and growing very old they produced such great and very hard coco - nuts, buried in the earth which is now covered by the sea. . . .

A region with this puzzling name appears in the Map of Blaeu (c. 1650), and as Ryk van Codavascan in the Map of Bengal in Valentijn (vol. v.), to the E. of Chittagong. Wilford has some Wilfordian nonsense about it, connecting it with the *TOKOSA/NNA R. of Ptolemy, and with a Touascan which he says is mentioned by the \"Portuguese writers\" (in such case a criminal mode of expression). The name was really that of a Mahommedan chief, \"hum Principe Mouro, grande Senhor,\" and \"Vassalo del Rey de Beng\u00e1la.\" It was probably \"Khod\u0101bakhsh Kh\u0101n.\" His territory must have been south of Chittagong, for one of his towns was Chacuri\u00e1, still known as Chakir\u012ba on the Chittagong and Arakan Road, in lat 21\u02da 45'.

Arab. \u1e33ahwa, a word which appears to have been originally a term for wine.* [So in the Arab. Nights, ii. 158, where Burton gives the derivation as akh\u00e1, fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food. In old days the scrupulous called coffee \u1e33ihwah to distinguish it from \u1e33ahwah, wine.] It is probable, therefore, that a somewhat similar word was twisted into this form by the usual propensity to strive after meaning. Indeed, the derivation of the name has been plausibly traced to Kaffa, one of those districts of the S. Abyssinian highlands (Enarea and Kaffa) which appear to have been the original habitat of the Coffee plant (Coffea arabica, L.); and if this is correct, then Coffee is nearer the original than \u1e32ahwa. On the other hand, \u1e32ahwa, or some form thereof, is in the earliest mentions appropriated to the drink, whilst some form of the word Bunn is that given to the plant, and B\u016bn is the existing name of the plant in Shoa. This name is also that applied in Yemen to the coffee-berry. There is very fair evidence in Arabic literature that the use of coffee was introduced into Aden by a certain Sheikh Shih\u0101budd\u012bn Dhab\u1e25\u0101n\u012b, who had made acquaintance with it on the African coast, and who died in the year H. 875, i.e. A.D. 1470, so that the introduction may be put about the middle of the 15th century, a time consistent with the other negative and positive data.\u2020 From Yemen it spread to Mecca (where there arose after some years, in 1511, a crusade against its use as unlawful), to Cairo, to Damascus and Aleppo, and to Constantinople, where the first coffee-house was established in 1554. [It is said to have been introduced into S. India It is curious that Ducange has a L. Latin word cahua, 'vinum album et debile.'\n See the extract in De Sacy's Chrestomathie Arabe cited below. Playfair, in his history of Yemen, says coffee was first introduced from Abyssinia by Jam\u0101ludd\u012bn Ibn Abdalla, K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b of Aden, in the middle of the 15th century: the person differs, but the time coincides.\n some two centuries ago by a Mahommedan pilgrim, named B\u0101b\u0101 B\u016bdan, who brought a few seeds with him from Mecca: see Grigg, Nilagiri Man. 483; Rice, Mysore, i. 162.] The first European mention of coffee seems to be by Rauwolff, who knew it in Aleppo in 1573. [See 1 ser. N. & Q. I. 25 seqq.] It is singular that in the Observations of Pierre Belon, who was in Egypt, 1546-49, full of intelligence and curious matter as they are, there is no indication of a knowledge of coffee.\n 1558. -- Extrait du Livre intitul\u00e9: \"Les Preuves le plus fortes en faveur de la legitimit\u00e9 de l'usage du Caf\u00e9 (Kahwa); par le Scheikh Abd - Alkader Ansari Dj\u00e9z\u00e9ri Hanbali, fils de Mohammed.\" -- In De Sacy, Chrest.

The fibre of the coco-nut husk, from which rope is made. But properly the word, which is Tam. kayiru, Malay\u0101l. k\u0101yar, from v. k\u0101y\u0101\u1e5bu. 'to be twisted,' means 'cord' itself (see the accurate Al-Bir\u016bn\u012b below). The former use among Europeans is very early. And both the fibre and the rope made from it appear to have been exported to Europe in the middle of the 16th century. The word appears in early Arabic writers in the forms \u1e33\u0101nbar and \u1e33anb\u0101r, arising probably from some misreading of the diacritical points (for \u1e33\u0101iyar, and \u1e33aiy\u0101r). The Portuguese adopted the word in the form cairo. The form coir seems to have been introduced by the English in the 18th century. [The N.E.D. gives coire in 1697; coir in 1779.] It was less likely to be used by the Portuguese because coiro in their language is 'leather.'

The chief mouth, or delta-branch, of the K\u0101veri River (see CAUVERY). It is a Portuguese corruption of the proper name Ko\u0306\u1e37\u1e37i\u1e0dam, vulg. Kolla\u1e0dam. This name, from Tam. ko\u0306l, 'to receive,' and 'i\u1e0dam,' 'place,' perhaps answers to the fact of this channel having been originally an escape formed at the construction of the great Tanjore irrigation works in the 11th century. In full flood the Coleroon is now, in places, nearly a mile wide, whilst the original stream of the K\u0101veri disappears before reaching the sea. Besides the etymology and the tradition, the absence of notice of the Coleroon in Ptolemy's Tables is (quantum valeat) an indication of its modern origin. As the sudden rise of floods in the rivers of the Coromandel coast often causes fatal accidents, there seems a curious popular tendency to connect the names of the rivers with this fact. Thus Ko\u0306lli\u1e0dam, with the meaning that has been explained, has been commonly made into Kolli\u1e0dam, 'Killing-place.' [So the Madras Gloss. which connects the name with a tradition of the drowning of workmen when the Srirangam temple was built, but elsewhere (ii. 213) it is derived from Tam. ko\u1e37\u1e37\u0101y\u012b, 'a breach in a bank.'] Thus also the two rivers Pe\u1e47\u1e47ar are popularly connected with pi\u1e47am, 'corpse.'

I. capp. 13, 14; also see Bishop Caldwell's Comp. Grammar, Introd., p. 103). It is thus intelligible how comparative geographers of the 16th century identified Ko\u0304ry with C. Comorin.\n In 1864 the late venerated Bishop Cotton visited C. Comorin in company with two of his clergy (both now missionary bishops). He said that having bathed at Hardw\u0101r, one of the most northerly of Hindu sacred places, he should like to bathe at this, the most southerly. Each of the chaplains took one of the bishop's hands as they entered the surf, which was heavy; so heavy that his right-hand aid was torn from him, and had not the other been able to hold fast, Bishop Cotton could hardly have escaped.*\n [1609. -- \". . . very strong cloth and is called Cacha de Comoree.\" -- Danxers, Letters, i. 29.\n [1767. -- \"The pagoda of the Cunnacomary belonging to Tinnevelly.\" -- Treaty, in Logan, Malabar, iii. 117.]\n 1817.- \". . .

This name appears prominently in some of the old maps of Bengal, e.g. that embraced in the Magni Mogolis Imperium of Blaeu's great Atlas (1645-50). It represents K\u0101mata, a State, and K\u0101matapur, a city, of which most extensive remains exist in the territory of Koch Bih\u0101r in Eastern Bengal (see COOCH BEHAR). These are described by Dr. Francis Buchanan, in the book published by Montgomery Martin under the name of Eastern India (vol. iii. 426 seqq.). The city stood on the west bank of the River Darl\u0101, which formed the defence on the east side, about 5 miles in extent. The whole circumference of the enclosure is estimated by Buchanan at 19 miles, the remainder being formed by a rampart which was (c. 1809) \"in general about 130 feet in width at the base, and from 20 to 30 feet in perpendicular height.\"\n 1553. -- \"Within the limits in which we I had this from one of the party, my respected friend Bishop Caldwell. -- H.

A hybrid of English and Hindustani, applied in modern Anglo-Indian colloquial to members of the Civil Service who have entered it by the competitive system first introduced in 1856. The phrase was probably the invention of one of the older or Haileybury members of the same service. These latter, whose nominations were due to interest, and who were bound together by the intimacies and esprit de corps of a common college, looked with some disfavour upon the children of Innovation. The name was readily taken up in India, but its familiarity in England is probably due in great part to the \"Letters of a Competition-wala,\" written by one who had no real claim to the title, Sir G. O. Trevelyan, who was later on member for Hawick Burghs, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and author of the excellent Life of his uncle, Lord Macaulay.\n The second portion of the word, w\u0101l\u0101, is properly a Hindi adjectival affix, corresponding in a general way to the Latin -arius. Its usual employment as affix to a substantive makes it frequently denote \"agent, doer, keeper, man, inhabitant, master, lord, possessor, owner,\" as Shakespear vainly tries to define it, and as in Anglo-Indian usage is popularly assumed to be its meaning. But this kind of denotation is incidental; there is no real limitation to such meaning. This is demonstrable from such phrases as K\u0101bul-w\u0101l\u0101 gho\u1e5b\u0101, 'the Kabulian horse,' and from the common form of village nomenclature in the Panj\u0101b, e.g. M\u012br-Kh\u0101n-w\u0101l\u0101, Ganda-Singh-W\u0101l\u0101, and so forth, implying the village established by MirKhan or Ganda-Singh.

But it did not involve competition; it only authorised a system by which writerships could be given to young men who had not been at Haileybury College, on their passing certain test examinations, and they were ranked according to their merit in passing such examinations, but below the writers who had left Haileybury at the preceding half-yearly examination. The first examination under this system was held 29th March, 1827, and Sir H. M. Elliot headed the list. The system continued in force for five years, the last examination being held in April, 1832. In all 83 civilians were nominated in this way, and, among other well-known names, the list included H. Torrens, Sir H. B. Harington, Sir R. Montgomery, Sir J. Cracroft Wilson, Sir T. Pycroft, W.

The enclosed ground, whether garden or waste, which surrounds an Anglo-Indian house. Various derivations have been suggested for this word, but its history is very obscure. The following are the principal suggestions that have been made: -- *\n (a.) That it is a corruption of some supposed Portuguese word.\n (b.) That it is a corruption of the French campagne.\n (c.) That it is a corruption of the Malay word kampung, as first (we believe) indicated by Mr. John Crawfurd.\n (a.) The Portuguese origin is assumed by Bishop Heber in passages quoted below. In one he derives it from campa\u00f1a (for which, in modern Portuguese at least, we should read campanha); but campanha is not used in such a sense. It seems to be used only for 'a campaign,' or for the Roman Campagna. In the other passage he derives it from campao (sic), but there is no such word.\n It is also alleged by Sir Emerson Tennent (infra), who suggests campinho; but this, meaning 'a small plain,' is not used for compound. Neither is the latter word, nor any word suggestive of it, used among the Indo-Portuguese.\n In the early Portuguese histories of India (e.g. Castanheda, iii. 436, 442; vi. 3) the words used for what we term compound, are jardim, patio, horta. An examination of all the passages of the Indo-Portuguese Bible, On the origin of this word for a long time different opinions were held by my lamented friend Burnell and by me. And when we printed a few specimens in the Indian Antiquary, our different arguments were given in brief (see I. A., July 1879, pp. 202, 203). But at a later date he was much disposed to come round to the other view, insomuch that in a letter of Sept. 21, 1881, he says: \"Compound can, I think, after all, be Malay Kampong; take these lines from a Malay poem\" -- then giving the lines which I have transcribed on the following page. I have therefore had no scruple in giving the same unity to this article that had been unbroken in almost all other cases. -- H. Y.\n where the word might be expected to occur, affords only horta.\n There is a use of campo by the Italian Capuchin P. Vincenzo Maria (Roma, 1672), which we thought at first to be analogous: \"Gionti alla porta della citt\u00e0 (Aleppo) . . . arrivati al Campo de' Francesi; doue \u00e8 la Dogana . . .\" (p. 475). We find also in Rauwolff's Travels (c. 1573), as published in English by the famous John Ray: \"Each of these nations (at Aleppo) have their peculiar Champ to themselves, commonly named after the Master that built it . . .\"; and again: \"When . . . the Turks have washed and cleansed themselves, they go into their Chappells, which are in the Middle of their great Camps or Carvatschars . . .\" (p. 84 and p. 259 of Ray's 2nd edition). This use of Campo, and Champ, has a curious kind of analogy to compound, but it is probably only a translation of Maid\u0101n or some such Oriental word.\n (b.) As regards campagne, which once commended itself as probable, it must be observed that nothing like the required sense is found among the seven or eight classes of meaning assigned to the word in Littr\u00e9.\n The word campo again in the Portuguese of the 16th century seems to mean always, or nearly always, a camp. We have found only one instance in those writers of its use with a meaning in the least suggestive of compound, but in this its real meaning is 'site': \"queymou a cidade toda ate na\u0303o ficar mais que ho campo em que estevera.\" (\"They burned the whole city till nothing remained but the site on which it stood\" -- Castanheda, vi. 130). There is a special use of campo by the Portuguese in the Further East, alluded to in the quotation from Pallegoix's Siam, but that we shall see to be only a representation of the Malay Kampung. We shall come back upon it. [See quotation from Correa, with note, under FACTORY.]\n (c.) The objection raised to kampung as the origin of compound is chiefly that the former word is not so used in Java by either Dutch or natives, and the author of Max Havelaar expresses doubt if compound is a Malay or Javanese word at all (pp. 360-361). Erf. is the usual word among the Dutch. In Java kampung seems to be used only for a native village, or for a particular ward or quarter of a town.\n But it is impossible to doubt that among the English in our Malay settlements compound is used in this sense in speaking English, and kampung in speaking Malay. Kampung is also used by the Malays themselves, in our settlements, in this sense. All the modern dictionaries that we have consulted give this sense among others. The old Dictionarium Malaico-Latinum of David Haex (Romae, 1631) is a little vague:\n \"Campon, coniunctio, vel conuentus. Hinc viciniae et parua loca, campon etiam appellantur.\"\n Crawfurd (1852): \"Kampung . . . an enclosure, a space fenced in; a village; a quarter or subdivision of a town.\"\n Favre (1875): \"Maison avec un terrain qui l'entoure.\"\n Pijnappel (1875), Maleisch-Hollandisch Woordenboek: \"Kampoeng Omheind Erf, Wijk, Buurt, Kamp,\" i.e. \"Ground hedged round, village, hamlet, camp.\"\n And also, let it be noted, the Javanese Dict. of P. Jansz (JavaanschNederlandsch Woordenboek, Samarang, 1876): \"Kampoeng -- Omheind erf van Woningen; wijk die onder een hoofd staat,\" i.e. \"Enclosed ground of dwellings; village which is under one Headman.\"\n Marre, in his Kata-Kata Malayou (Paris, 1875), gives the following expanded definition: \"Village palissad\u00e9, ou, dans une ville, quartier s\u00e9par\u00e9 et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement clos, occup\u00e9 par des gens de m\u00eame nation, Malays, Siamois, Chinois, Bouguis, &c. Ce mot signifie proprement un enclos, une enciente, et par extension quartier clos, faubourg, ou village palissad\u00e9. Le mot Kampong d\u00e9signe parfois aussi une maison d'une certaine importance avec le terrain clos qui en d\u00e9pend, et qui l'entoure\" (p. 95).\n We take Marsden last (Malay Dictionary, 1812) because he gives an illustration: \"Kampong, an enclosure, a place surrounded with a paling; a fenced or fortified village; a quarter, district, or suburb of a city; a collection of buildings. Memb\u00fbat [to make] rumah [house] serta da\u00f1gan [together with] kampong-nia [compound thereof], to erect a house with its enclosure . . . Ber-Kampong, to assemble, come together; me\u00f1gampong, to collect, to bring together.\" The Reverse Dictionary gives: \"YARD, alaman, Kampong.\" [See also many further references much to the same effect in Scott, Malayan Words, p. 123 seqq.]\n In a Malay poem given in the Journal of the Ind. Archipelago, vol i. p. 44, we have these words:-\n \"Tr\u00fasl\u00e1h ka kampong s'orange Saud\u00e1gar.\" [\"Passed to the kampong of a Merchant.\"] and \"Tit\u00e1h b\u00e1gind\u00fa raj\u00e1 sult\u00e1n\u00ed K\u00e1mpong \u015bi\u00e1p\u00e1 gar\u00e1ngun \u00edn\u00ed.\" [\"Thus said the Prince, the Raja Sultani, Whose kampong may this be?\"]\n These explanations and illustrations render it almost unnecessary to add in corroboration that a friend who held office in the Straits for twenty years assures us that the word kampung is habitually used, in the Malay there spoken, as the equivalent of the Indian compound. If this was the case 150 years ago in the English settlements at Bencoolen and elsewhere (and we know from Marsden that it was so 100 years ago), it does not matter whether such a use of kampung was correct or not, compound will have been a natural corruption of it. Mr. E. C. Baber, who lately spent some time in our Malay settlements on his way from China, tells me (H. Y.) that the frequency with which he heard kampung applied to the 'compound,' convinced him of this etymology, which he had before doubted greatly.\n It is not difficult to suppose that the word, if its use originated in our Malay factories and settlements, should have spread to the continental Presidencies, and so over India.\n Our factories in the Archipelago were older than any of our settlements in India Proper. The factors and writers were frequently moved about, and it is conceivable that a word so much wanted (for no English word now in use does express the idea satisfactorily) should have found ready acceptance. In fact the word, from like causes, has spread to the ports of China and to the missionary and mercantile stations in tropical Africa, East and West, and in Madagascar.\n But it may be observed that it was possible that the word kampung was itself originally a corruption of the Port. campo, taking the meaning first of camp, and thence of an enclosed area, or rather that in some less definable way the two words reacted on each other. The Chinese quarter at Batavia Kampong Tzina -- is commonly called in Dutch 'het Chinesche Kamp' or 'het Kamp der Chinezen.' Kampung was used at Portuguese Malacca in this way at least 270 years ago, as the quotation from Godinho de Eredia shows. The earliest Anglo-Indian example of the word compound is that of 1679 (below). In a quotation from Dampier (1688) under Cot, where compound would come in naturally, he says 'yard.'\n 1613. -- (At Malacca). \"And this settlement is divided into 2 parishes, S. Thom\u00e9 and S. Stephen, and that part of S. Thom\u00e9 called Campon Chelim extends from the shore of the Jaos bazar to N.W., terminating at the Stone Bastion; and in this dwell the Chelis of Coromandel. . . . And the other part of S. Stephen's, called Campon China, extends from the said shore of the Jaos Bazar, and mouth of the river to the N.E., . . . and in this part, called Campon China, dwell the Chincheos . . . and foreign traders, and native fishermen.\" -- Godinho, de Eredia, i. 6. In the plans given by this writer, we find different parts of the city marked accordingly, as Campon Chelim, Campon China, Campon Bendara (the quarter where the native magistrate, the Bend\u0101ra lived).

The Portuguese had a factory here for a good many years after their expulsion from Ormus, and under treaty with Persia, made in 1625, had a right of pearlfishing at Bahrein and a claim to half of the customs of Cong. These claims seem to have been gradually disregarded, and to have had no effect after about 1670, though the Portuguese would appear to have still kept up some pretext of monopoly of rights there in 1677 (see Chardin, ed. 1735, i. 348, and Bruce's Annals of the E.I.C., iii. 393). Some confusion is created by the circumstance that there is another place on the same coast, called Kong\u016bn, which possessed a good many vessels up to 1859, when it was destroyed by a neighbouring chief (see Stiffe's P.

At Canton this was a range of buildings adjoining the foreign Factories, called also the 'Council Hall' of the foreign Factories. It was the property of the body of Hong merchants, and was the place of meeting of these merchants among themselves, or with the chiefs of the Foreign houses, when there was need for such conference (see Fankwae, p. 23).

In Upper India the term has frequently a specific application to the lower class of labourer who carries earth, bricks, &c., as distinguished from the skilled workman, and even from the digger.\n The original of the word appears to have been a nomen gentile, the name (Kol\u012b) of a race or caste in Western India, who have long performed such offices as have been mentioned, and whose savagery, filth, and general degradation attracted much attention in former times, [see Hamilton, Descr. of Hindostan (1820), i. 609]. The application of the word would thus be analogous to that which has rendered the name of a Slav, captured and made a bondservant, the word for such a bondservant in many European tongues.

Carter the Kol\u012bs proper are a true hill-people, whose especial locality lies in the Western Gh\u0101ts, and in the northern extension of that range, between 18\u02da and 24\u02da N. lat.

C. of N.W.P. iii. 294).] In the R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101 [ed. 1878, p. 78 seqq.] the Koolies are spoken of as a tribe who lived long near the Indus, but who were removed to the country of the Null (the Nal, a brackish lake some 40 m. S.W. of Ahmedabad) by the goddess Hingl\u0101j.\n Though this explanation of the general use of the term Cooly is the most probable, the matter is perplexed by other facts which it is difficult to trace to the same origin. Thus in S. India there is a Tamil and Can. word k\u016bli in common use, signifying 'hire' or 'wages,' which Wilson indeed regards as the true origin of Cooly. [Oppert (Orig. Inhab. of Bharatavarsa, p. 131) adopts the same view, and disputing the connection of Cooly with Koli or Kol, regards the word as equivalent to 'hired servant' and originating in the English Factories on the E. coast.] Also in both Oriental and Osmanli Turkish kol is a word for a slave, whilst in the latter also k\u016bleh means 'a male slave, a bondsman' (Redhouse). Khol is in Tibetan also a word for a servant or slave (Note from A. Schiefner; see also J\u00e4schke's Tibetan Dict., 1881, p. 59). But with this the Indian term seems to have no connection. The familiar use of Cooly has extended to the Straits Settlements, Java, and China, as well as to all tropical and sub-tropical colonies, whether English or foreign.\n In the quotations following, those in which the race is distinctly intended are marked with an *.\n *1548. -- \"And for the duty from the Col\u00e9s who fish at the sea-stakes and on the river of Bacaim. . . .\" -- S.

This is the name of a fruit described by Varthema, Acosta, and other old writers, the identity of which has been the subject of much conjecture. It is in reality the Garcinia indica, Choisy (N. O.

It produces an agreeable, acid, purple fruit, which the Portuguese call brind\u00f5es. From the seeds a fatty oil is drawn, known as kokun butter. The name in Malay\u0101l. is ko\u1e0dukka, and this possibly, with the addition of puli, 'acid,' gave rise to the name before us. It is stated in the English Cyclopaedia (Nat. Hist. s.v. Garcinia) that in Travancore the fruit is called by the natives gharka pulli, and in Ceylon goraka.

The first of our quotations shows the word in a form very closely allied to this, and explaining the transition. Wilson gives Telugu khorjam, \"a bale or lot of 20 pieces, commonly called a corge.\" [The Madras Gloss. gives Can. korji, Tel. khorjam, as meaning either a measure of capacity, about 44 maunds, or a Madras town cloth measure of 20 pieces.] But, unless a root can be traced, this may easily be a corruption of the trade-word. Littr\u00e9 explains corge or courge as \"Paquet de toile de coton des Indes\"; and Marcel Devic says: \"C'est vraisemblablement l'Arabe khordj\" -- which means a saddlebag, a portmanteau. Both the definition and the etymology seem to miss the essential meaning of corge, which is that of a score, and not that of a packet or bundle, unless by accident.\n 1510. -- \"If they be stuffs, they deal by curia, and in like manner if they be jewels.

This is confirmed by the form Cournakea in Valentijn, and by another title which he gives as used for the head of the Elephant Stable at Matura, viz. Gaginaicke (Names, &c., p. 11), i.e.Gajin\u0101yaka, from Gaja, 'an elephant.'

Bock, Temples and Elephants, p. 22.\n", "coromandel": "n.p. A name which has been long applied by Europeans to the Northern Tamil Country, or (more comprehensively) to the eastern coast of the Peninsula of India from Pt. Calimere northward to the mouth of the Kistna, sometimes to Orissa. It corresponds pretty nearly to the Maabar of Marco Polo and the Mahommedan writers of his age, though that is defined more accurately as from C. Comorin to Nellore.\n Much that is fanciful has been written on the origin of this name. Tod makes it K\u016br\u016b-mandala, the Realm of the K\u016br\u016bs (Trans. R. As. Soc. iii. 157). Bp. Caldwell, in the first edition of his Dravidian Grammar, suggested that European traders might have taken this familiar name from that of Karuma\u1e47al ('black sand'), the name of a small village on the coast north of Madras, which is habitually pronounced and written Coromandel by European residents at Madras. [The same suggestion was made earlier (see Wilks, Hist. Sketches, ed. 1869, i. 5, \"This elephant is a very pious animal\" -- a German friend once observed in India, misled by the double sense of his vernacular fromm ('harmless, tame' as well as 'pious or innocent').\n note)]. The learned author, in his second edition, has given up this suggestion, and has accepted that to which we adhere. But Mr. C. P. Brown, the eminent Telugu scholar, in repeating the former suggestion, ventures positively to assert: \"The earliest Portuguese sailors pronounced this Coromandel, and called the whole coast by this name, which was unknown to the Hindus\";* a passage containing in three lines several errors. Again, a writer in the Ind. Antiquary (i. 380) speaks of this supposed origin of the name as \"pretty generally accepted,\" and proceeds to give an imaginative explanation of how it was propagated. These etymologies are founded on a corrupted form of the name, and the same remark would apply to Kharama\u1e47\u1e0dalam, the 'hot country,' which Bp. Caldwell mentions as one of the names given, in Telugu, to the eastern coast. Padre Paolino gives the name more accurately as Ciola (i.e. Chola) ma\u1e47\u1e0dalam, but his explanation of it as meaning the Country of Cholam (or iuw\u0101r\u012b -- Sorghum vulgare, Pers.) is erroneous. An absurd etymology is given by Teixeira (Relacion de Harmuz, 28; 1610). He writes: \"Choroma\u0303del or Choro Ba\u0303del, i.e. Rice Port, because of the great export of rice from thence.\" He apparently compounds H. chaul, ch\u0101wal, 'cooked rice' (!) and bandel, i.e. bandar (q.v.) 'harbour.' This is a very good type of the way etymologies are made by some people, and then confidently repeated.\n The name is in fact Ch\u00f4\u1e5bama\u1e47\u1e0dala, the Realm of Ch\u00f4\u1e5ba; this being the Tamil form of the very ancient title of the Tamil Kings who reigned at Tanjore. This correct explanation of the name was already given by D'Anville (see \u00c9claircissemens, p. 117), and by W. Hamilton in 1820 (ii. 405), by Ritter, quoting him in 1836 (Erdkunde, vi. 296); by the late M. Reinaud in 1845 (Relation, &c., i. lxxxvi.); and by Sir Walter Elliot in 1869 (J. Ethnol. Soc. N.S. i. 117). And the name occurs in the forms Cholama\u1e47\u1e0dalam or Solama\u1e47\u1e0dalam on the great Temple inscription of Tanjore (11th century), and in an inscription of A.D. 1101 at a temple dedi J.R.A.S., N.S. v. 148. He had said the same in earlier writings, and was apparently the original author of this suggestion. [But see above.]\n cated to Var\u0101hasv\u0101mi near the Seven Pagodas. We have other quite analogous names in early inscriptions, e.g. Ilama\u1e47\u1e0dalam (Ceylon), Cherama\u1e47\u1e0dalam, Tondaima\u1e47\u1e0dalam, &c.\n Chola, as the name of a Tamil people and of their royal dynasty appears as Cho\u1e0da in one of Asoka's inscriptions, and in the Telugu inscriptions of the Ch\u0101lukya dynasty. Nor can we doubt that the same name is represented by *SW=RA of Ptolemy who reigned at *)ARKATOU= (Arcot), *SW/R-NAC who reigned at *)/ORQOURA (Wari\u016br), and the *SW=RAI NOMA/DES who dwelt inland from the site of Madras.*\n The word Soli, as applied to the Tanjore country, occurs in Marco Polo (Bk. iii. ch. 20), showing that Chola in some form was used in his day. Indeed Soli is used in Ceylon.\u2020 And although the Choromandel of Baldaeus and other Dutch writers is, as pronounced in their language, ambiguous or erroneous, Valentijn (1726) calls the country Sjola, and defines it as extending from Negapatam to Orissa, saying that it derived its name from a certain kingdom, and adding that mandalam is 'kingdom.'\u2021 So that this respectable writer had already distinctly indicated the true etymology of Coromandel.\n Some old documents in Valentijn speak of the 'old city of Coromandel.' It is not absolutely clear what place was so called (probably by the Arabs in their fashion of calling a chief town by the name of the country), but the indications point almost certainly to Negapatam.\u0015\n The oldest European mention of the name is, we believe, in the Roteiro de Vasco da Gama, where it appears as Chomandarla. The short Italian narrative of Hieronymo da Sto. Stefano is, however, perhaps earlier still, and he curiously enough gives the name in exactly the modern form \"Coromandel,\" though perhaps his C See Bp. Caldwell's Comp. Gram., 18, 95, &c.\n See Tennent, i. 395.\n \"This coast bears commonly the corrupted name of Choromandel, and is now called only thus; but the right name is Sjola-mandalam, after Sjola, a certain kingdom of that name, and mandalam, 'a kingdom,' one that used in the old times to be an independent and mighty empire.\" -- Val. v. 2.\n e.g. 1675. -- \"Hence the country . . . has become very rich, wherefore the Portuguese were induced to build a town on the site of the old Gentoo (Jentiefze) city Chiormandelan.\" -- Report on the Dutch Conquests in Ceylon and S. India, by Rykloof Van Goens in Valentijn, v. (Ceylon) 234.\n had originally a cedilla (Ramusio, i. f. 345v.). These instances suffice to show that the name was not given by the Portuguese. Da Gama and his companions knew the east coast only by hearsay, and no doubt derived their information chiefly from Mahommedan traders, through their \"Moorish\" interpreter. That the name was in familiar Mahommedan use at a later date may be seen from Rowlandson's Translation of the Tohfat-ul-Muj\u0101hid\u012bn, where we find it stated that the Franks had built fortresses \"at Meelapoor (i.e. Mailapur or San Tom\u00e9) and Nagapatam, and other ports of Solmundul,\" showing that the name was used by them just as we use it (p. 153). Again (p. 154) this writer says that the Mahommedans of Malabar were cut off from extra-Indian trade, and limited \"to the ports of Guzerat, the Concan, Solmondul, and the countries about Kaeel.\" At page 160 of the same work we have mention of \"Coromandel and other parts,\" but we do not know how this is written in the original Arabic. Varthema (1510) has Ciormandel, i.e. Chormandel, but which Eden in his translation (1577, which probably affords the earliest English occurrence of the name) deforms into Cyromandel (f. 396b). [Albuquerque in his Cartas (see p. 135 for a letter of 1513) has Choromandell passim.] Barbosa has in the Portuguese edition of the Lisbon Academy, Charamandel; in the Span. MS. translated by Lord Stanley of Alderley, Cholmendel and Cholmender. D'Alboquerque's Commentaries (1557), Mendez Pinto (c. 1550) and Barros (1553) have Choromandel, and Garcia De Orta (1563) Charamandel. The ambiguity of the ch, soft in Portuguese and Spanish, but hard in Italian, seems to have led early to the corrupt form Coromandel, which we find in Parkes's Mendoza (1589), and Coromandyll, among other spellings, in the English version of Castanheda (1582). Cesare Federici has in the Italian (1587) Chiaramandel (probably pronounced soft in the Venetian manner), and the translation of 1599 has Coromandel. This form thenceforward generally prevails in English books, but not without exceptions. A Madras document of 1672 in Wheeler has Cormandell, and so have the early Bengal records in the India Office; Dampier (1689) has Coromondel (i. 509); Lockyer (1711) has \"the Coast of Cormandel\"; A. Hamilton (1727) Chormondel (i. 349); ed. 1744, i. 351; and a paper of about 1759, published by Dalrymple, has \"Choromandel Coast\" (Orient. Repert. i. 120-121). The poet Thomson has Cormandel:\n \"all that from the tract Of woody mountains stretch'd through gorgeous Ind Fall on Cormandel's Coast or Maiabar.\" Summer.\n The Portuguese appear to have adhered in the main to the correcter form Choromandel: e.g. Archivio Port. Oriental, fasc. 3, p. 480, and passim. A Protestant Missionary Catechism, printed at Tranquebar in 1713 for the use of Portuguese schools in India has: \"na costa dos Malabaros que se chama Cormandel.\" Bernier has \"la c\u00f4te de Koromandel\" (Amst. ed. ii. 322). W. Hamilton says it is written Choramandel in the Madras Records until 1779, which is substantially correct. In the MS. \"List of Persons in the Service of the Rt. Honble. E. I. Company in Fort St. George and other places on the Coast of Choromandell,\" preserved in the Indian Office, that spelling continues down to 1778. In that year it is changed to Coromandel. In the French translation of Ibn Batuta (iv. 142) we find Coromandel, but this is only the perverse and misleading manner of Frenchmen, who make Julius Caesar cross from \"France\" to \"England.\" The word is Ma'bar in the original. [Alboquerque (Comm. Hak. Soc. i. 41) speaks of a violent squall under the name of vara de Coromandel. ]\n", "corporal forbes": "s.

An enclosure as used in Ceylon for the capture of wild elephants, corresponding to the Keddah of Bengal. The word is Sp. corral, 'a court,' &c., Port. curral. 'a cattle-pen, a paddock.' The Americans have the same word, direct from the Spanish, in common use for a cattle-pen; and they have formed a verb 'to corral,' i.e. to enclose in a pen, to pen. The word kraal applied to native camps and villages at the Cape of Good Hope appears to be the same word introduced there by the Dutch. The word corral is explained by Bluteau: \"A receptacle for any kind of cattle, with railings round it and no roof, in which respect it differs from Corte, which is a building with a roof.\" Also he states that the word is used especially in churches for septum nobilium feminarum, a pen for ladies.\n c. 1270. -- \"When morning came, and I rose and had heard mass, I proclaimed a council to be held in the open space (corral) between my house and that of Montaragon.\"- Chron. of James of Aragon, tr. by Foster, i. 65.\n 1404. -- \"And this mosque and these chapels were very rich, and very finely wrought with gold and azure, and enamelled tiles (azulejos); and within there was a great corral, with trees and tanks of water.\"- Clavijo, \u0015 cv.

This name is given by many travellers in the 16th and 17th centuries to a port on the western side of the Irawadi Delta, which must have been near Bassein, if not identical with it. Till quite recently this was all that could be said on the subject, but Prof. Forchhammer of Rangoon has now identified the name as a corruption of the classical name formerly borne by Bassein, viz. Kusima or Kusumanagara, a city founded about the beginning of the 5th century. Kusimama\u1e47\u1e0dala was the western province of the Delta Kingdom which we know as Pegu. The Burmese corrupted the name of Kusuma into Kusmein and Kothein, and Alompra after his conquest of Pegu in the middle of the 18th century, changed it to Bathein. So the facts are stated substantially by Forchhammer (see Notes on Early Hist. and Geog. of Br. Burma, No. 2, p. 12); though familiar and constant use of the word Persaim, which appears to be a form of Bassein, in the English writings of 1750-60, published by Dalrymple (Or. Repertory, passim), seems hardly consistent with this statement of the origin of Bassein. [Col. Temple (Ind. Ant. xxii. 19 seqq.; J. R. A. S. 1893, p. 885) disputes the above explanation. According to him the account of the change of name by Alompra is false history; the change from initial p to k is not isolated, and the word Bassein itself does not date beyond 1780.]\n The last publication in which Cosmin appears is the \"Draught of the River Irrawaddy or Irabatty,\" made in 1796, by Ensign T. Wood of the Bengal Engineers, which accompanies Symes's Account (London, 1800). This shows both Cosmin, and Persaim or Bassein, some 30 or 40 miles apart.

This is a name which used greatly to perplex us on the 16th and 17th century maps of India, e.g. in Blaeu's Atlas (c. 1650), appearing generally to the west of the Ganges Delta. Considering how the geographical names of different ages and different regions sometimes get mixed up in old maps, we at one time tried to trace it to the *KASPA/TUROS of Herodotus, which was certainly going far afield! The difficulty was solved by the sagacity of the deeply-lamented Prof. Blochmann, who has pointed out (J. As. Soc. Beng., xlii. pt. i. 224) that Cospetir represents the Bengali genitive of Gajpati, 'Lord of Elephants,' the traditional title of the Kings of Orissa. The title Gajpati was that one of the Four Great Kings who, according to Buddhist legend, divided the earth among them in times when there was no Chakravartti, or Universal Monarch (see CHUCKERBUTTY). Gajapati rules the South; A\u015bvapati (Lord of Horses) the North; Chhatrapati (Lord of the Umbrella) the West; Narapati (Lord of Men) the East. In later days these titles were variously appropriated (see Lassen, ii. 27 seq.). And Akbar, as will be seen below, adopted these names, with others of his own devising, for the suits of his pack of cards.

The most usual popular measure of distance in India, but like the mile in Europe, and indeed like the mile within the British Islands up to a recent date, varying much in different localities.\n The Skt. word is kro\u015ba, which also is a measure of distance, but originally signified 'a call,' hence the distance at which a man's call can be heard.*\n In the Pali vocabulary called Abhidh\u0101nappad\u012bp\u012bk\u0101, which is of the 12th century, the word appears in the form koss; and nearly this, kos, is the ordinary Hindi. Kuroh is a Persian form of the word, which is often found in Mahommedan authors and in early travellers. These latter (English) often write course. It is a notable circumstance that, according to Wrangell, the Yakuts of N. Siberia reckon distance by kiosses (a word which, considering the Russian way of writing Turkish and Persian words, must be identical with kos). With them this measure is \"indicated by the time necessary to cook a piece of meat.\" Kioss is=to about 5 versts, or 1\u2154 miles, in hilly or marshy country, but on plain ground to 7 versts, or 2\u2153 miles.\u2020 The Yakuts are a Turk people, and their language is a Turki dialect. The suggestion arises whether the form kos may not have come with the Mon \"It is characteristic of this region (central forests of Ceylon) that in traversing the forest they calculate their march, not by the eye, or by measures of distance, but by sounds. Thus a 'dog's cry' indicates a quarter of a mile; a 'cock's crow,' something more; and a 'hoo' implies the space over which a man can be heard when shouting that particular monosyllable at the pitch of his voice.\" -- Tennent's Ceylon, ii. 582. In S. Canara also to this day such expressions as \"a horn's blow,\" \"a man's call,\" are used in the estimation of distances. [See under GOW.]\n Le Nord de la Sib\u00e9rie, i. 82.\n gols into India, and modified the previous kro\u015ba? But this is met by the existence of the word kos in Pali, as mentioned above.\n In ancient Indian measurement, or estimation, 4 kro\u015bas went to the yojana. Sir H. M. Elliot deduced from distances in the route of the Chinese pilgrim Fa-hian that the yojana of his age was as nearly as possible 7 miles. Cunningham makes it 7\u00bd or 8, Fergusson 6; but taking Elliot's estimate as a mean, the ancient kos would be 1\u00be miles.\n The kos as laid down in the \u0100\u012bn [ed. Jarrett, iii. 414] was of 5000 gaz [see GUDGE]. The official decision of the British Government has assigned the length of Akbar's Il\u0101h\u012b gaz as 33 inches, and this would make Akbar's kos= 2 m. 4 f. 183\u2153 yards. Actual measurement of road distances between 5 pair of Akbar's kos-min\u0101rs,* near Delhi, gave a mean of 2 m. 4 f. 158 yards.\n In the greater part of the Bengal Presidency the estimated kos is about 2 miles, but it is much less as you approach the N.W. In the upper part of the Doab, it is, with fair accuracy, 1\u00bc miles. In Bundelkhand again it is nearly 3 m. (Carnegy), or, according to Beames, even 4 m. [In Madras it is 2\u00bc m., and in Mysore the Sult\u0101n\u012b kos is about 4 m.] Reference may be made on this subject to Mr. Thomas's ed. of Prinsep's Essays, ii. 129; and to Mr. Beames's ed. of Elliot's Glossary (\"The Races of the N.-W. Provinces,\" ii. 194). The latter editor remarks that in several parts of the country there are two kinds of kos, a pakk\u0101 and a kachch\u0101 kos, a double system which pervades all the weights and measures of India; and which has prevailed also in many other parts of the world [see PUCKA].\n c. 500. -- \"A gavy\u016btih (or league -- see GOW) is two krosas.\" -- Amarakosha, ii. 2, 18.\n c. 600. -- \"The descendant of Kukulstha (i.e. R\u0101ma) having gone half a kro\u015ba. . . .\"- Raghuvams\u0101, xiii. 79.\n c. 1340. -- \"As for the mile it is called among the Indians al-Kur\u016bh.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 95.\n \" \"The Sultan gave orders to assign me a certain number of villages. . . . \". . . that Royal Alley of Trees planted by the command of Jehan-Guire, and continued by the same order for 150 leagues, with little Pyramids or Turrets erected every half league.\" -- Bernier, E.T. 91; [ed.

A light bedstead. There is a little difficulty about the true origin of this word. It is universal as a sea-term, and in the South of India. In Northern India its place has been very generally taken by charpoy (q.v.), and cot, though well understood, is not in such prevalent European use as it formerly was, except as applied to barrack furniture, and among soldiers and their families. Words with this last characteristic have very frequently been introduced from the south. There are, however, both in north and south, vernacular words which may have led to the adoption of the term cot in their respective localities. In the north we have H. kh\u0101\u1e6d and kha\u1e6dw\u0101, both used in this sense, the latter also in Sanskrit; in the south, Tam. and Malay\u0101l. ka\u1e6d\u1e6dil, a form adopted by the Portuguese. The quotations show, however, no Anglo-Indian use of the word in any form but cot.\n The question of origin is perhaps further perplexed by the use of quatre as a Spanish term in the West Indies (see Tom Cringle below). A Spanish lady tells us that catre, or catre de tigera (\"scissors-cot\") is applied to a bedstead with X-trestles. Catre is also common Portuguese for a wooden bedstead, and is found as such in a dictionary of 1611. These forms, however, we shall hold to be of Indian origin; unless it can be shown that they are older in Spain and Portugal than the 16th century. The form quatre has a curious analogy (probably accidental) to ch\u0101rp\u0101\u012b.\n 1553. -- \"The Camarij (Zamorin) who was at the end of a house, placed on a bedstead, which they call catle. . . .\" -- De Barros, Dec.

V. defines it as: \"Ketaul, garde de forteresse, chef de la garnison; nom d'un tribu d'Ozbegs;\" P. \"kot\u0101wal,kot\u0101w\u0101l, gardien d'une citadelle.\" There are many Turki words of analogous form, as \u1e33ar\u0101wal, 'a vidette,' ba\u1e33\u0101wal, 'a table-steward,' yas\u0101wal, 'a chamberlain, ' tang\u0101wal, 'a patrol,' &c. In modern Bokhara Kataul is a title conferred on a person who superintends the Amir's buildings (Khanikoff, 241). On the whole it seems probable that the title was originally Turki, but was shaped by Indian associations.\n [The duties of the Kotw\u0101l, as head of the police, are exhaustively laid down in the \u0100\u012bn (Jarrett, ii. 41). Amongst other rules: \"He shall amputate the hand of any who is the pot-companion of an executioner, and the finger of such as converse with his family.\"] The office of Kotw\u0101l in Western and Southern India, technically speaking, ceased about 1862, when the new police system (under Act, India, V. of 1861, and corresponding local Acts) was introduced. In Bengal the term has been long obsolete.

This is the title by which the natives in Calcutta generally designate English barristers. It is the same use as the Irish one of Counsellor, and a corruption of that word.\n", "country": "adj. This term is used colloquially, and in trade, as an adjective to distinguish articles produced in India (generally with a sub-indication of disparagement), from such as are imported, and especially imported from Europe. Indeed Europe (q.v.) was, and still occasionally is, used as the contrary adjective. Thus, 'country harness' is opposed to 'Europe harness'; 'country-born' people are persons of European descent, but born in India; 'country horses' are Indianbred in distinction from Arabs, Walers (q.v.), English horses, and even from 'stud-breds,' which are horses reared in India, but from foreign sires; 'country ships' are those which are owned in Indian ports, though often officered by Europeans; country bottled beer is beer imported from England in cask and bottled in India; ['country-wound' silk is that reeled in the crude native fashion]. The term, as well as the H. des\u012b, of which country is a translation, is also especially used for things grown or made in India as substitutes for certain foreign articles. Thus the Cicca disticha in Bombay gardens is called 'Country gooseberry'; Convolvulus batatas, or sweet potato, is sometimes called the 'country potato.' It was, equally with our quotidian root which has stolen its name, a foreigner in India, but was introduced and familiarised at a much earlier date. Thus again des\u012b b\u0101d\u0101m, or 'country almond,' is applied in Bengal to the nut of the Terminalia Catappa. On des\u012b, which is applied, among other things, to silk, the great Ritter (dormitans Homerus) makes the odd remark that des\u012b is just Seide reversed! But it would be equally apposite to remark that Trigon-ometry is just Country-ometry reversed!\n Possibly the idiom may have been taken up from the Portuguese, who also use it, e.g. 'a\u00e7afrao da terra,' 'country saffron,' i.e. safflower, otherwise called bastard saffron, the term being sometimes applied to turmeric. But the source of the idiom is general, as the use of des\u012b shows. Moreover the Arabic balad\u012b, having the same literal meaning, is applied in a manner strictly analogous, including the note of disparagement, insomuch that it has been naturalised in Spanish as indicating 'of little or no value.' Illustrations of the mercantile use of beledi (i.e. balad\u012b) will be found in a note to Marco Polo, 2nd ed. ii. 370. For the Spanish use we may quote the Dict. of Cobarruvias (1611): \"Baladi, the thing which is produced at less cost, and is of small duration and profit.\" (See also Dozy and Engelmann, 232 seq.)\n 1516. -- \"Beledyn ginger grows at a distance of two or three leagues all round the city of Calicut. . . .

This is in Bengal the name of a peculiar dry kind of curry, often served as a breakfast dish. We can only conjecture that it was a favourite dish at the table of the skippers of 'country ships,' who were themselves called 'country captains,' as in our first quotation. In Madras the term is applied to a spatchcock dressed with onions and curry stuff, which is probably the original form. [Riddell says: \"Countrycaptain. -- Cut a fowl in pieces; shred an onion small and fry it brown in butter; sprinkle the fowl with fine salt and curry powder and fry it brown; then put it into a stewpan with a pint of soup; stew it slowly down to a half and serve it with rice\" (Ind.

Compare in M. Polo, Bk. I., ch. 18, his statement about the Caraonas, and note thereon.\n", "crape": "s. This is no Oriental word, though crape comes from China. It is the French cr\u00eape, i.e. crespe, Lat. crispus, meaning frizzed or minutely curled. As the word is given in a 16th century quotation by Littr\u00e9, it is probable that the name was first applied to a European texture.

A kind of dagger, which is the characteristic weapon of the Malay nations; from the Javanese name of the weapon, adopted in Malay, kr\u012bs, kir\u012bs, or kres (see Favre, Dict. Javanais-Fran\u00e7ais, 137b, Crawfurd's Malay Dict. s.v., Jansz, Javaansch-Nederl. Woordenboek, 202). The word has been generalised, and is often applied to analogous weapons of other nations, as 'an Arab crease,' &c. It seems probable that the H. word kirich, applied to a straight sword, and now almost specifically to a sword of European make, is identical with the Malay word kr\u012bs. See the form of the latter word in Barbosa, almost exactly kirich. Perhaps Turki k\u012bl\u012bch is the original. [Platts gives Skt. k\u1e5biti, 'a sort of knife or dagger.'] If Reinaud is right in his translation of the Arab Relations of the 9th and 10th centuries, in correcting a reading, otherwise unintelligible, to khr\u012b, we shall have a very early adoption of this word by Western travellers. It occurs, however, in a passage relating to Ceylon.\n c. 910. -- \"Formerly it was common enough to see in this island a man of the country walk into the market grasping in his hand a khr\u012b, i.e. a dagger peculiar to the country, of admirable make, and sharpened to the finest edge. The man would lay hands on the wealthiest of the merchants that he found, take him by the throat, brandish his dagger before his eyes, and finally drag him outside of the town. . . .\"- Relation, &c., par Reinaud, p. 156; and see Arabic text, p. 120, near bottom.\n It is curious to find the cris adopted by Alboquerque as a piece of state costume. When he received the ambassadors of Sheikh Ismael, i.e. the Sh\u0101h of Persia, Ismael S\u016bf\u012b, at Ormuz, we read:\n 1515. -- \"For their reception there was prepared a dais of three steps . . . which was covered with carpets, and the Governor seated thereon in a decorated chair, arrayed in a tunic and surcoat of black damask, with his collar, and his golden cris, as I described before, and with his big, long snow-white beard; and at the back of the dais the captains and gentlemen, handsomely attired, with their swords girt, and behind them their pages with lances and targets, and all uncovered.\" -- Correa, ii. 423.\n The portrait of Alboquerque in the 1st vol. of Mr. Birch's Translation of the Commentaries, realises the snow-white beard, tunic, and black surcoat, but the cris is missing.

In the East the staple food consists of some cereal, either (as in N. India) in the form of flour baked into unleavened cakes, or boiled in the grain, as rice is. Such food having little taste, some small quantity of a much more savoury preparation is added as a relish, or 'kitchen,' to use the phrase of our forefathers. And this is in fact the proper office of curry in native diet. It consists of meat, fish, fruit, or vegetables, cooked with a quantity of bruised spices and turmeric [see MUSSALLA]; and a little of this gives a flavour to a large mess of rice. The word is Tam. kari, i.e. 'sauce'; [kari, v. 'to eat by biting']. The Canarese form karil was that adopted by the Portuguese, and is still in use at Goa. It is remarkable in how many countries a similar dish is habitual; pil\u0101o [see PILLAU] is the analogous mess in Persia, and kuskussu in Algeria; in Egypt a dish well known as ruzz mufalfal [Lane, Mod. Egypt, ed. 1871, i. 185], or \"peppered rice.\" In England the proportions of rice and \"kitchen\" are usually reversed, so that the latter is made to constitute the bulk of the dish.\n The oldest indication of the Indian cuisine in this kind, though not a very precise one, is cited by Athenaeus from Megasthenes: \"Among the Indians, at a banquet, a table is set before each individual . . . and on the table is placed a golden dish on which they throw, first of all, boiled rice . . . . and then they add many sorts of meat dressed after the Indian fashion\" (Athen., by Yonge, iv. 39). The earliest precise mention of curry is in the Mahavanso (c. A.D. 477), where it is said of Kassapo that \"he partook of rice dressed in butter, with its full accompaniment of curries.\" This is Turnour's translation, the original Pali being s\u016bpa.\n It is possible, however, that the kind of curry used by Europeans and Mahommedans is not of purely Indian origin, but has come down from the spiced cookery of medieval Europe and Western Asia. The medieval spiced dishes in question were even coloured like curry. Turmeric, indeed, called by Garcia de Orta, Indian saffron, was yet unknown in Europe, but it was represented by saffron and sandalwood. A notable incident occurs in the old English poem of King Richard, wherein the Lion-heart feasts on the head of a Saracen-\n \"soden full hastily With powder and with spysory, And with saffron of good colour.\"\n Moreover, there is hardly room for doubt that capsicum or red pepper (see CHILLY) was introduced into India by the Portuguese (see Hanbury andFl\u00fcckiger, 407); and this spice constitutes the most important ingredient in modern curries. The Sanskrit books of cookery, which cannot be of any considerable antiquity, contain many recipes for curry without this ingredient. A recipe for curry (caril) is given, according to Bluteau, in the Portuguese Arte de Cozinha, p. 101. This must be of the 17th century.\n It should be added that kari was, among the people of S. India, the name of only one form of 'kitchen' for rice, viz. of that in consistency resembling broth, as several of the earlier quotations indicate. Europeans have applied it to all the savoury concoctions of analogous spicy character eaten with rice. These may be divided into three classes -- viz. (1), that just noticed; (2), that in the form of a stew of meat, fish or vegetables; (3), that called by Europeans 'dry curry.' These form the successive courses of a Hindu meal in S. India, and have in the vernaculars several discriminating names.\n In Java the Dutch, in their employment of curry, keep much nearer to the original Hindu practice. At a breakfast, it is common to hand round with the rice a dish divided into many sectoral spaces, each of which contains a different kind of curry, more or less liquid.\n According to the Fankwae at Canton (1882), the word is used at the Chinese ports (we presume in talking with Chinese servants) in the form k\u0101\u0101rle (p. 62).\n 1502. -- \"Then the Captain-major commanded them to cut off the hands and ears of all the crews, and put all that into one of the small vessels, into which he ordered them to put the friar, also without ears or nose or hands, which he ordered to be strung round his neck with a palm-leaf for the King, on which he told him to have a curry (caril) made to eat of what his friar brought him.\" -- Correa, Three Voyages, Hak. Soc. 331. The \"Friar\" was a Brahman, in the dress of a friar, to whom the odious ruffian Vasco da Gama had given a safe-conduct.\n 1563. -- \"They made dishes of fowl and flesh, which they call caril.\" -- Garcia, f. 68.\n c. 1580. -- \"The victual of these (renegade soldiers) is like that of the barbarous people; that of Moors all bringe [birinj, 'rice']; that of Gentoos rice-carril.\" -- Primor e Honra, &c., f. 9v.\n 1598. -- \"Most of their fish is eaten with rice, which they seeth in broth, which they put upon the rice, and is somewhat soure, as if it were sodden in gooseberries, or unripe grapes, but it tasteth well, and is called Carriel [v.l. Carriil], which is their daily meat.\" -- Linschoten, 88; [Hak. Soc. ii. 11]. This is a good description of the ordinary tamarind curry of S. India.\n 1606. -- \"Their ordinary food is boiled rice with many varieties of certain soups which they pour upon it, and which in those parts are commonly called caril.\" -- Gouvea, 61b.\n 1608-1610. -- \". . . me disoit qu'il y auoit plus de 40 ans, qu'il estoit esclaue, et auoit gagn\u00e9 bon argent \u00e0 celuy qui le possedoit; et toute fois qu'il ne luy donnoit pour tout viure qu'vne mesure de riz cru par iour sans autre chose . . . et quelquefois deux baseruques, qui sont quelque deux deniers (see BUDGROOK), pour auoir du Caril \u00e0 mettre auec le riz.\" -- Mocquet, Voyages, 337.\n 1623. -- \"In India they give the name of caril to certain messes made with butter, with the kernel of the coco-nut (in place of which might be used in our part of the world milk of almonds) . . . with spiceries of every kind, among the rest cardamom and ginger . . . with vegetables, fruits, and a thousand other condiments of sorts; . . . and the Christians, who eat everything, put in also flesh or fish of every kind, and sometimes eggs . . . with all which things they make a kind of broth in the fashion of our guazzetti (or hotch-potches) . . . and this broth with all the said condiments in it they pour over a good quantity of rice boiled simply with water and salt, and the whole makes a most savoury and substantial mess.\" -- P. della Valle, ii. 709; [Hak.

The name in India of a fruit (Anona squamosa, L.) originally introduced from S. America, but which spread over India during the 16th century. Its commonest name in Hindustan is shar\u012bfa, i.e. 'noble'; but it is also called S\u012btap'hal, i.e. 'the Fruit of S\u012bt\u0101,' whilst another Anona ('bullock's heart,' A. reticulata, L., the custard-apple of the W. Indies, where both names are applied to it) is called in the south by the name of her husband R\u0101ma. And the S\u012btap'hal and R\u0101mp'hal have become the subject of Hindu legends (see Forbes, Or. Mem. iii. 410). The fruit is called in Chinese Fan-li-chi, i.e. foreign leechee.\n A curious controversy has arisen from time to time as to whether this fruit and its congeners were really imported from the New World, or were indigenous in India. They are not mentioned among Indian fruits by Baber (c. A.D. 1530), but the translation of the \u0100\u012bn (c. 1590) by Prof. Blochmann contains among the \"Sweet Fruits of Hindustan,\" Custard-apple (p. 66). On referring to the original, however, the word is sad\u0101p'hal (fructus perennis), a Hind. term for which Shakespear gives many applications, not one of them the anona. The bel is one (Aegle marmelos), and seems as probable as any (see BAEL). The custard-apple is not mentioned by Garcia de Orta (1563), Linschoten (1597), or even by P. della Valle (1624). It is not in Bontius (1631), nor in Piso's commentary on Bontius (1658), but is described as an American product in the West Indian part of Piso's book, under the Brazilian name Araticu. Two species are described as common by P. Vincenzo Maria, whose book was published in 1672. Both the custard-apple and the sweet-sop are fruits now generally diffused in India; but of their having been imported from the New World, the name Anona, which we find in Oviedo to have been the native West Indian name of one of the species, and which in various corrupted shapes is applied to them over different parts of the East, is an indication. Crawfurd, it is true, in his Malay Dictionary explains nona or buah- (\"fruit\") nona in its application to the custard-apple as fructus virginalis, from nona, the term applied in the Malay countries (like missy in India) to an unmarried European lady. But in the face of the American word this becomes out of the question.\n It is, however, a fact that among the Bharhut sculptures, among the carvings dug up at Muttra by General Cunningham, and among the copies from wall-paintings at Ajanta (as pointed out by Sir G. Birdwood in 1874, (see Athenaeum, 26th October), [Bombay Gazetteer, xii. 490]) there is a fruit represented which is certainly very like a custard-apple (though an abnormally big one), and not very like anything else yet pointed out. General Cunningham is convinced that it is a custard-apple, and urges in corroboration of his view that the Portuguese in introducing the fruit (which he does not deny) were merely bringing coals to Newcastle; that he has found extensive tracts in various parts of India covered with the wild custard-apple; and also that this fruit bears an indigenous Hindi name, \u0101t\u0101 or \u0101t, from the Sanskrit \u0101t\u1e5bipya.\n It seems hard to pronounce about this \u0101t\u1e5bipya. A very high authority, Prof. Max M\u00fcller, to whom we once referred, doubted whether the word (meaning 'delightful') ever existed in real Sanskrit. It was probably an artificial name given to the fruit, and he compared it aptly to the factitious Latin of aureum malum for \"orange,\" though the latter word really comes from the Sanskrit n\u0101ranga. On the other hand, \u0101t\u1e5bipya is quoted by R\u0101ja R\u0101dhakant Deb, in his Sanskrit dictionary, from a medieval work, the Dravyaguna. And the question would have to be considered how far the MSS. of such a work are likely to have been subject to modern interpolation. Sanskrit names have certainly been invented for many objects which were unknown till recent centuries. Thus, for example, Williams gives more than one word for cactus, or prickly pear, a class of plants which was certainly introduced from America (see Vidara and Vi\u015bvasaraka, in his Skt. Dictionary).\n A new difficulty, moreover, arises as to the indigenous claims of \u0101t\u0101, which is the name for the fruit in Malabar as well as in Upper India. For, on turning for light to the splendid works of the Dutch ancients, Rheede and Rumphius, we find in the former (Hortus Malabaricus, part iv.) a reference to a certain author, 'Recchus de Plantis Mexicanis,' as giving a drawing of a custard-apple tree, the name of which in Mexico was ahat\u00e9 or at\u00e9, \"fructu apud Mexicanos praecellenti arbor nobilis\" (the expressions are noteworthy, for the popular Hindustani name of the fruit is shar\u012bfa=\"nobilis\"). We also find in a Manilla Vocabulary that ate or atte is the name of this fruit in the Philippines. And from Rheede we learn that in Malabar the \u0101t\u0101 was sometimes called by a native name meaning \"the Manilla jack-fruit\"; whilst the Anona reticulata, or sweetsop, was called by the Malabars \"the Parangi (i.e. Firingi or Portuguese) jack-fruit.\"\n These facts seem to indicate that probably the \u0101t\u0101 and its name came to India from Mexico via\u0302 the Philippines, whilst the anona and its name came to India from Hispaniola via\u0302 the Cape. In the face of these probabilities the argument of General Cunningham from the existence of the tree in a wild state loses force. The fact is undoubted and may be corroborated by the following passage from \"Observations on the nature of the Food of the Inhabitants of South India,\" 1864, p. 12: -- \"I have seen it stated in a botanical work that this plant (Anona sq.) is not indigenous, but introduced from America, or the W. Indies. If so, it has taken most kindly to the soil of the Deccan, for the jungles are full of it\": [also see Watt, Econ. Dict. ii. 259 seq., who supports the foreign origin of the plant]. The author adds that the wild custard-apples saved the lives of many during famine in the Hyderabad country. But on the other hand, the Argemone Mexicana, a plant of unquestioned American origin, is now one of the most familiar weeds all over India. The cashew (Anacardium occidentale), also of American origin, and carrying its American name with it to India, not only forms tracts of jungle now (as Sir G. Birdwood has stated) in Canara and the Concan (and, as we may add from personal knowledge, in Tanjore), but was described by P. Vincenzo Maria, more than two hundred and twenty years ago, as then abounding in the wilder tracts of the western coast.\n The question raised by General Cunningham is an old one, for it is alluded to by Rumphius, who ends by leaving it in doubt. We cannot say that we have seen any satisfactory suggestion of another (Indian) plant as that represented in the ancient sculpture of Bharhut. [Dr. Watt says: \"They may prove to be conventional representations of the jack-fruit tree or some other allied plant; they are not unlike the flower-heads of the sacred kadamba or Anthocephalus,\" (loc. cit. i. 260)]. But it is well to get rid of fallacious arguments on either side.\n In the \"Materia Medica of the Hindus by Udoy Chand Dutt, with a Glossary by G. King, M.B., Calc. 1877,\" we find the following synonyms given:-\n \"Anona squamosa: Skt. Gan\u1e0dagatra; Beng. \u0100t\u0101; Hind.

And this is in analogy with many other cases of mountain nomenclature, where the name of a pass has been transferred to a mountain chain, or where the word for 'a pass' has been mistaken for a word for 'mountain range.' The proper sense of the word is well illusstrated from Sir A. Wellesley, under b.\n a.-\n 1809. -- \"The dandys there took to their paddles, and keeping the beam to the current the whole way, contrived to land us at the destined gaut.\" -- Ld. Valentia, i. 185.\n 1824. -- \"It is really a very large place, and rises from the river in an amphitheatral form . . . with many very fine gha\u0302ts descending to the water's edge.\" -- Heber, i. 167.\n b.-\n c. 1315. -- \"In 17 more days they arrived at Gurganw. During these 17 days the Gh\u00e1ts were passed, and great heights and depths were seen amongst the hills, where even the elephants became nearly invisible.\" -- Am\u012br Khusr\u016b, in Elliot, iii. 86.\n This passage illustrates how the transition from b to c occurred. The Gh\u0101ts here meant are not a range of mountains so called, but, as the context shows, the passes among the Vindhya and S\u0101tp\u016bra hills. Compare the two following, in which 'down the ghauts' and 'down the passes' mean exactly the same thing, though to many people the former expression will suggest 'down through a range of mountains called the Ghauts.'\n 1803. -- \"The enemy are down the ghauts in great consternation.\" -- Wellington, ii. 333.\n \" \"The enemy have fled northward, and are getting down the passes as fast as they can.\" -- M. Elphinstone, in Life by Colebrooke, i. 71.\n 1826. -- \"Though it was still raining, I walked up the Bohr Gha\u0302t, four miles and a half, to Candaulah.\" -- Heber, ii. 136, ed. 1844. That is, up one of the Passes, from which Europeans called the mountains themselves \"the Ghauts.\"\n The following passage indicates that the great Sir Walter, with his usual sagacity, saw the true sense of the word in its geographical use, though misled by books to attribute to the (so-called) 'Eastern Ghauts' the character that belongs to the Western only.\n 1827. -- \". . . they approached the Ghauts, those tremendous mountain passes which descend from the table-land of Mysore, and through which the mighty streams that arise in the centre of the Indian Peninsula find their way to the ocean.\" -- The Surgeon's Daughter, ch. xiii.\n c.-\n 1553. -- \"The most notable division which Nature hath planted in this land is a chain of mountains, which the natives, by a generic appellation, because it has no proper name, call Gate, which is as much as to say Serra.\" -- De Barros, Dec. I. liv. iv. cap. vii.\n 1561. -- \"This Serra is called Gate.\" -- Correa, Lendas, ii. 2, 56.\n 1563. -- \"The Cuncam, which is the land skirting the sea, up to a lofty range which they call Guate.\" -- Garcia, f. 34b.\n 1572.- \"Da terra os Naturaes lhe chamam Gate, Do pe do qual pequena quantidade Se estende hu\u0303a fralda estreita, que combate Do mar a natural ferocidade. . . .\" Cam\u00f5es, vii. 22.\n Englished by Burton:\n \"The country-people call this range the Ghaut, and from its foot-hills scanty breadth there be, whose seaward - sloping coast-plain long hath fought 'gainst Ocean's natural ferocity. . . .\"\n 1623. -- \"We commenced then to ascend the mountain-(range) which the people of the country call Gat, and which traverses in the middle the whole length of that part of India which projects into the sea, bathed on the east side by the Gulf of Bengal, and on the west by the Ocean, or Sea of Goa.\"- -- P. della Valle, ii. 32; [Hak. Soc. ii. 222].\n 1673. -- \"The Mountains here are one continued ridge . . . and are all along called Gaot.\" -- Fryer, 187.\n 1685. -- \"On les appelle, montagnes de Gatte, c'est comme qui diroit montagnes de montagnes, Gatte en langue due pays ne signifiant autre chose que montagne\" (quite wrong). -- Ribeyro, Ceylan, (Fr. Transl.), p. 4.\n 1727. -- \"The great Rains and Dews that fall from the Mountains of Gatti, which ly 25 or 30 leagues up in the Country.\" -- A. Hamilton, i. 282; [ed. 1744, ii. 285].\n 1762. -- \"All the South part of India save the Mountains of Gate (a string of Hills in ye country) is level Land the Mould scarce so deep as in England. . . . As you make use of every expedient to drain the water from your tilled ground, so the Indians take care to keep it in theirs, and for this reason sow only in the level grounds.\" -- MS. Letter of James Rennell, March 21.\n 1826. -- \"The mountains are nearly the same height . . . with the average of Welsh mountains. . . . In one respect, and only one, the Gha\u0302ts have the advantage, -- their precipices are higher, and the outlines of the hills consequently bolder.\" -- Heber, ed. 1844, ii. 136.\n"}
