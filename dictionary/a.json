{"abada": "s. A word used by old Spanish and Portuguese writers for a 'rhinoceros,' and adopted by some of the older English narrators. The origin is a little doubtful. If it were certain that the word did not occur earlier than c. 1530-40, it would most probably be an adoption from the Malay badak, 'a rhinoceros.' The word is not used by Barros where he would probably have used it if he knew it (see quotation under GANDA); and we have found no proof of its earlier existence in the language of the Peninsula; if this should be established we should have to seek an Arabic origin in such a word as abadat, \u0101bid, fem. \u0101bida, of which one meaning is (v. Lane) 'a wild animal.' The usual form abada is certainly somewhat in favour of such an origin. [Prof. Skeat believes that the a in abada and similar Malay words represents the Arabic article, which was commonly used in Spanish and Portuguese prefixed to Arabic and other native words.] It will be observed that more than one authority makes it the female rhinoceros, and in the dictionaries the word is feminine. But so Barros makes Ganda. [Mr W. W. Skeat suggests that the female was the more dangerous animal, or the one most frequently met with, as is certainly the case with the crocodile.]\n 1541. -- \"Mynes of Silver, Copper, Tin, and Lead, from whence great quantities thereof were continually drawn, which the Merchants carried away with Troops of Elephants and Rhinoceroses (em cafilas de elefantes e badas) for to transport into the Kingdoms of Sornau, by us called Siam, Passiloco, Sarady, (Savady in orig.), Tangu, Prom,Calaminham and other Provinces . . . . \" -- Pinto (orig. cap. xli.) in Cogan, p. 49.

This last is the sense in which it is used by Anglo-Indians. In every district of India the privilege of selling spirits is farmed to contractors, who manage the sale through retail shopkeepers. This is what is called the 'Abkary System.' The system has often been attacked as promoting tippling, and there are strong opinions on both sides. We subjoin an extract from a note on the subject, too long for insertion in integrity, by one of much experience in Bengal -- Sir G. U. Yule.\n June, 1879. -- \"Natives who have expressed their views are, I believe, unanimous in ascribing the increase of drinking to our Abkaree system. I don't say that this is putting the cart before the horse, but they are certainly too forgetful of the increased means in the country, which, if not the sole cause of the increased consumption, has been at least a very large factor in that result. I myself believe that more people drink now than formerly; but I knew one gentleman of very long and intimate knowledge of Bengal, who held that there was as much drinking in 1820 as in 1860.\"\n In any case exaggeration is abundant.

Formerly the Cantonment of Secrole at Benares was also known, by a transfer no doubt, as Chhot\u0101 (or 'Little') Ach\u0101nak. Two additional remarks may be relevantly made: (1) Job's name was certainly Charnock, and not Channock. It is distinctly signed \"Job Charnock,\" in a MS. letter from the factory at \"Chutta,\" i.e. Chuttanuttee (or Calcutta) in the India Office records, which I have seen. (2) The map in Valentijn which shows the village of Tsjannok, though published in 1726, was apparently compiled by Van der Broecke in 1662. Hence it is not probable that it took its name from Job Charnock, who seems to have entered the Company's service in 1658. When he went to Bengal we have not been able to ascertain.

Ar. -- H. -- 'ad\u0101lat, 'a Court of Justice,' from 'adl, 'doing justice.' Under the Mohammedan government there were 3 such courts, viz., Niz\u0101mat'Ad\u0101lat, D\u012bw\u0101n\u012b Ad\u0101lat, and Faujd\u0101r\u012b 'Ad\u0101lat, so-called from the respective titles of the officials who nominally presided over them. The first was the chief Criminal Court, the second a Civil Court, the third a kind of Police Court. In 1793 regular Courts were established under the British Government, and then the Sudder Adawlut (\u1e62adr 'Ad\u0101lat) became the chief Court of Appeal for each Presidency, and its work was done by several European (Civilian) Judges. That Court was, on the criminal side, termed Nizamut Adawlat, and on the civil side Dewanny Ad. At Madras and Bombay, Foujdarry was the style adopted in lieu of Nizamut. This system ended in 1863, on the introduction of the Penal Code, and the institution of the High Courts on their present footing. (On the original history and constitution of the Courts see Fifth Report, 1812, p. 6.)\n What follows applies only to the Bengal Presidency, and to the administration of justice under the Company's Courts beyond the limits of the Presidency town. Brief particulars regarding the history of the Supreme Courts and those Courts which preceded them will be found under SUPREME COURT.\n The grant, by Sh\u0101h '\u0100lam, in 1765, of the Dewanny of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa to the Company, transferred all power, civil and military, in those provinces, to that body. But no immediate attempt was made to undertake the direct detailed administration of either revenue or justice by the agency of the European servants of the Company. Such superintendence, indeed, of the administration was maintained in the prior acquisitions of the Company -- viz., in the Zemindary of Calcutta, in the Twenty-four Pergunnas, and in the Chucklas (Chucklah) or districts of Burdwan, Midnapoor, and Chittagong, which had been transferred by the Nawab, K\u0101sim 'Ali Kh\u0101n, in 1760; but in the rest of the territory it was confined to the agency of a Resident at the Moorshedabad Durbar, and of a 'Chief' at Patna. Justice was administered by the Mohammedan courts under the native officials of the Dewanny.\n In 1770, European officers were appointed in the districts, under the name of Supervisors, with powers of control over the natives employed in the collection of the Revenue and the administration of justice, whilst local councils, with superior authority in all branches, were established at Moorshedabad and Patna. It was not till two years later that, under express orders from the Court of Directors, the effective administration of the provinces was undertaken by the agency of the Company's covenanted servants. At this time (1772) Courts of Civil Justice (Mofussil Dewanny Adawlut) were established in each of the Districts then recognised. There were also District Criminal Courts (Foujdary Adawlut) held by Cazee or Mufty under the superintendence, like the Civil Court, of the Collectors, as the Supervisors were now styled; whilst Superior Courts (Sudder Dewanny, Sudder Nizamut Adawlut) were established at the Presidency, to be under the superintendence of three or four members of the Council of Fort William.\n In 1774 the Collectors were recalled, and native 'Amils (Aumil) appointed in their stead. Provincial Councils were set up for the divisions of Calcutta, Burdwan, Dacca, Moorshedabad, Dinagepore, and Patna, in whose hands the superintendence, both of revenue collection and of the administration of civil justice, was vested, but exercised by the members in rotation.\n The state of things that existed under this system was discreditable. As Courts of Justice the provincial Councils were only \"colourable imitations of courts, which had abdicated their functions in favour of their own subordinate (native) officers, and though their decisions were nominally subject to the Governor-General in Council, the Appellate Court was even a more shadowy body than the Courts of first instance. The Court never sat at all, though there are some traces of its having at one time decided appeals on the report of the head of the Khalsa, or native exchequer, just as the Provincial Council decided them on the report of the Cazis and Muftis.\"*\n In 1770 the Government resolved that Civil Courts, independent of the Provincial Councils, should be established in the six divisions named above,\u2020 each under a civilian judge with the title of Superintendent of the Dewanny Adawlut; whilst to the Councils should still pertain the trial of causes relating to the public revenue, to the demands of zemindars upon their tenants, and to boundary questions. The appeal from the District Courts still lay to the Governor-General and his Council, as forming the Court of Sudder Dewanny; but that this might be real, a judge was appointed its head in the person of Sir Elijah Impey, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, an appointment which became famous. For it was represented as a transaction intended to compromise the acute dis Sir James Stephen, in Nuncomar and Impey, ii. 221.\n These six were increased in 1781 to eighteen.\n sensions which had been going on between that Court and the Bengal Government, and in fact as a bribe to Impey. It led, by an address from the House of Commons, to the recall of Impey, and constituted one of the charges in the abortive impeachment of that personage. Hence his charge of the Sudder Dewanny ceased in November, 1782, and it was resumed in form by the Governor-General and Council.\n In 1787, the first year of Lord Cornwallis's government, in consequence of instructions from the Court of Directors, it was resolved that, with an exception as to the Courts at Moorshedabad, Patna, and Dacca, which were to be maintained independently, the office of judge in the Mofussil Courts was to be attached to that of the collection of the revenue; in fact, the offices of Judge and Collector, which had been divorced since 1774, were to be reunited. The duties of Magistrate and Judge became mere appendages to that of Collector; the administration of justice became a subordinate function; and in fact all Regulations respecting that administration were passed in the Revenue Department of the Government.\n Up to 1790 the criminal judiciary had remained in the hands of the native courts. But this was now altered; four Courts of Circuit were created, each to be superintended by two civil servants as judges; the Sudder Nizamut Adawlut at the Presidency being presided over by the Governor-General and the members of Council.\n In 1793 the constant succession of revolutions in the judicial system came to something like a pause, with the entire reformation which was enacted by the Regulations of that year. The Collection of Revenue was now entirely separated from the administration of justice; Zillah Courts under European judges were established (Reg. iii.) in each of 23 Districts and 3 cities, in Bengal, Behar, and Orissa; whilst Provincial Courts of Appeal, each consisting of three judges (Reg. v.), were established at Moorshedabad, Patna, Dacca, and Calcutta. From these Courts, under certain conditions, further appeal lay to the Sudder Dewanny Adawluts at the Presidency. \n As regarded criminal jurisdiction, the judges of the Provincial Courts were also (Reg. ix., 1793) constituted Circuit Courts, liable to review by the Sudder Nizamut. Strange to say, the impracticable idea of placing the duties of both of the higher Courts, civil and criminal, on the shoulders of the executive Government was still maintained, and the Governor-General and his Council were the constituted heads of the Sudder Dewanny and Sudder Nizamut. This of course continued as unworkable as it had been; and in Lord Wellesley's time, eight years later, the two Sudder Adawluts were reconstituted, with three regular judges to each, though it was still ruled (Reg. ii., 1801) that the chief judge in each Court was to be a member of the Supreme Council, not being either the Governor-General or the Commander-in-Chief. This rule was rescinded by Reg. x. of 1805.\n The number of Provincial and Zillah Courts was augmented in after years with the extension of territory, and additional Sudder Courts, for the service of the Upper Provinces, were established at Allahabad in 1831 (Reg. vi.), a step which may be regarded as the inception of the separation of the N.W. Provinces into a distinct Lieutenant-Governorship, carried out five years later. But no change that can be considered at all organic occurred again in the judiciary system till 1862; for we can hardly consider as such the abolition of the Courts of Circuit in 1829 (Reg. i.), and that of the Provincial Courts of Appeal initiated by a section in Reg. v. of 1831, and completed in 1833.\n 1822. -- \"This refers to a traditional story which Mr. Elphinstone used to relate . . . .

A bird so called (no doubt) from its comical resemblance to a human figure in a stiff dress pacing slowly on a parade-ground. It is the H. ha\u1e5bg\u012bl\u0101, or gigantic crane, and popular scavenger of Bengal, the Leptoptilus argala of Linnaeus. The H. name is by some dictionaries derived from a supposed Skt. word ha\u1e0d\u1e0da-gila, 'bone-swallower.' The compound, however appropriate, is not to be found in B\u00f6htlingk and Roth's great Dictionary. The bird is very well described by Aelian, under the name of *KH/LA, which is perhaps a relic of the still preserved vernacular one. It is described by another name, as one of the peculiarities of India, by Sultan Baber. See PELICAN.\n \"The feathers known as Marabou or Comercolly feathers, and sold in Calcutta, are the tail-coverts of this, and the Lept. Javanica, another and smaller species\" (Jerdon). The name marabout (from the Ar. mur\u0101bit, 'quiet,' and thence 'a hermit,' through the Port. marabuto) seems to have been given to the bird in Africa on like reason to that of adjutant in India.

Anim. xvi. 4.\n c. 1530. -- \"One of these (fowls) is the d\u012bng, which is a large bird. Each of its wings is the length of a man; on its head and neck there is no hair. Something like a bag hangs from its neck; its back is black, its breast white; it frequently visits K\u0101bul. One year they caught and brought me a d\u012bng, which became very tame. The flesh which they threw it, it never failed to catch in its beak, and swallowed without ceremony. On one occasion it swallowed a shoe well shod with iron; on another occasion it swallowed a good-sized fowl right down, with its wings and feathers.\" -- Baber, 321.\n 1754. -- \"In the evening excursions . . . . we had often observed an extraordinary species of birds, called by the natives Argill or Hargill, a native of Bengal.

The Ak\u0101lis may be regarded as the Wah\u0101bis of Sikhism. They claim their body to have been instituted by Guru Govind himself, but this is very doubtful. Cunningham's view of the order is that it was the outcome of the struggle to reconcile warlike activity with the abandonment of the world; the founders of the Sikh doctrine rejecting the inert asceticism of the Hindu sects. The Ak\u0101lis threw off all subjection to the earthly government, and acted as the censors of the Sikh community in every rank. Runjeet Singh found them very difficult to control. Since the annexation of the Panjab, however, they have ceased to give trouble. The Akalee is distinguished by blue clothing and steel armlets. Many of them also used to carry several steel chakras (CHUCKER) encircling their turbans.

The European name of the seat of administration of the British province of Arakan, which is also a port exporting rice largely to Europe. The name is never used by the natives of Arakan (of the Burmese race), who call the town Tsit-htw\u00e9, 'Crowd (in consequence of) War.' This indicates how the settlement came to be formed in 1825, by the fact of the British force encamping on the plain there, which was found to be healthier than the site of the ancient capital of the kingdom of Arakan, up the valley of the Arakan or Kaladyne R. The name Aky\u00e1b had been applied, probably by the Portuguese, to a neighbouring village, where there stands, about 1\u00bd miles from the present town, a pagoda covering an alleged relique of Gautama (a piece of the lower jaw, or an induration of the throat), the name of which pagoda, taken from the description of relique, is Au-kyait-dau, and of this Aky\u00e1b was probably a corruption. The present town and cantonment occupy dry land of very recent formation, and the high ground on which the pagoda stands must have stood on the shore at no distant date, as appears from the finding of a small anchor there about 1835. The village adjoining the pagoda must then have stood at the mouth of the Arakan R., which was much frequented by the Portuguese and the Chittagong people in the 16th and 17th centuries, and thus probably became known to them by a name taken from the Pagoda.- (From a note by Sir Arthur Phayre.) [Col. Temple writes -- \"The only derivation which strikes me as plausible, is from the Agyattaw Phaya, near which, on the island of Sittw\u00e9, a Cantonment was formed after the first Burmese war, on the abandonment of Mrohaung or Arakan town in 1825, on account of sickness among the troops stationed there.

This name is given in the Bombay Presidency to a tinned-copper stew-pan, having a cover, and staples for straps, which is carried on the march by European soldiers, for the purpose of cooking in, and eating out of. Out on picnics a larger kind is frequently used, and kept continually going, as a kind of pot-au-feu. [It has been suggested that the word may be a corr. of some French or Port. term -- Fr. braiser; Port. brazeiro, 'a fire-pan,' braza, 'hot coals.']\n", "albacore": "s. A kind of rather large sea-fish, of the Tunny genus (Thynnus albacora, Lowe, perhaps the same as Thynnus macropterus, Day); from the Port. albacor or albecora. The quotations from Ovington and Grose below refer it to albo, but the word is, from its form, almost certainly Arabic, though Dozy says he has not found the word in this sense in Arabic dictionaries, which are very defective in the names of fishes (p. 61). The word albacora in Sp. is applied to a large early kind of fig, from Ar. alb\u0101k\u016br, 'praecox' (Dozy), Heb. bikk\u016bra, in Micah vii. 1. -- See Cobarruvias, s. v. Albacora.

The great seabird (Diomedea exulans, L.), from the Port. alcatraz, to which the forms used by Hawkins and Dampier, and by Flacourt (according to Marcel Devic) closely approach. [Alcatras 'in this sense altered to albi-, albe-, albatross (perhaps with etymological reference to albus, \"white,\" the albatross being white, while the alcatras was black.') N.E.D. s.v.] The Port. word properly means 'a pelican.' A reference to the latter word in our Glossary will show another curious misapplication. Devic states that alcatruz in Port. means 'the bucket of a Persian wheel,'* representing the Ar. al-k\u0101d\u016bs, which is again from KA/DOS. He supposes that the pelican may have got this name in the same way that it is called in ordinary Ar. sa\u1e33\u1e33a, 'a water-carrier.' It has been pointed out by Dr Murray, that the alcatruz of some of the earlier voyagers, e.g., of Davis below, is not the Diomedea, but the Man-of-War (or Frigate) Bird (Fregatus aquilus). Hawkins, at p. 187 of the work quoted, describes, without naming, a bird which is evidently the modern albatross. In the quotation from Mocquet again, alcatruz is applied to some smaller sea-bird. The passage from Shelvocke is that which suggested to Coleridge \"The Ancient Mariner.\"\n 1564. -- \"The 8th December we ankered by a small Island called Alcatrarsa, wherein at our going a shoare, we found nothing but sea-birds, as we call them Ganets, but by the Portugals called Alcatrarses, who for that cause gave the said Island the same name.\" -- Hawkins (Hak.

The \"Summary of the Western Indies\" by Pietro Martire d'Angheria, as given in Ramusio, recounting the last voyage of Columbus, says that, in a certain river, \"they sometimes encountered those crocodiles which they call Lagarti; these make away when they see the Christians, and in making away they leave behind them an odour more fragrant than musk.\" (Ram. iii. f. 17v.). Oviedo, on another page of the same volume, calls them \"Lagarti o dragoni\" (f. 62).\n Bluteau gives \"Lagarto, Crocodilo\" and adds: \"In the Oriente Conquistado (Part I. f. 823) you will find a description of the Crocodile under the name of Lagarto.\"\n One often, in Anglo-Indian conversation, used to meet with the endeavour to distinguish the two well-known species of the Ganges as Crocodile and Alligator, but this, like other applications of popular and general terms to mark scientific distinctions, involves fallacy, as in the cases of 'panther, leopard,' 'camel, dromedary,' 'attorney, solicitor,' and so forth. The two kinds of Gangetic crocodile were known to Aelian (c. 250 A.D.), who writes: \"It (the Ganges) breeds two kinds of crocodiles; one of these is not at all hurtful, while the other is the most voracious and cruel eater of flesh; and these have a horny prominence on the top of the nostril.

The name as here given is an extravagant, and that of avocato or avogato a more moderate, corruption of aguacate or ahuacatl (see below), which appears to have been the native name in Central America, still surviving there. The Quichua name is palta, which is used as well as aguacat\u00e9 by Cieza de Leon, and also by Joseph de Acosta. Grainger (Sugarcane, Bk.

America call it Aguacate, and under that name it is described by Ulloa.\" In French it is called avocat. The praise which Grainger, as quoted below, \"liberally bestows\" on this fruit, is, if we might judge from the specimens occasionally met with in India, absurd. With liberal pepper and salt there may be a remote suggestion of marrow: but that is all. Indeed it is hardly a fruit in the ordinary sense.

In India it has several uses as applied to native officials employed under the Civil Courts, but nearly all reducible to the definition of fide-commissarius. Thus an ameen may be employed by a Court to investigate accounts connected with a suit, to prosecute local enquiries of any kind bearing on a suit, to sell or to deliver over possession of immovable property, to carry out legal process as a bailiff, &c.

The word in this form perhaps first became familiar as applied to the Princes of Sind, at the time of the conquest of that Province by Sir. C. J. Napier. It is the title affected by many Musulman sovereigns of various calibres, as the Am\u012br of K\u0101bul, the Am\u012br of Bokh\u0101r\u0101, &c. But in sundry other forms the word has, more or less, taken root in European languages since the early Middle Ages. Thus it is the origin of the title 'Admiral,' now confined to generals of the sea service, but applied in varying forms by medieval Christian writers to the Am\u012brs, or lords, of the court and army of Egypt and other Mohammedan States. The word also came to us again, by a later importation from the Levant, in the French form, Emir or Emer. -- See also Omrah, which is in fact Umar\u0101, the pl. of Am\u012br. Byzantine writers use *)AME\\R, *)AMHRA=S, *)AMURA/S, *)AMHRAI=OS, &c. (See Ducange, Gloss. Gr\u0153cit.) It is the opinion of the best scholars that the forms Amiral, Ammiraglio, Admiral &c., originated in the application of a Low Latin termination -alis or -alius, though some doubt may still attach to this question. (See Marcel Devic, s.v. Amiral, and Dozy, Oosterlingen, s.v. Admiraal [and N.E.D. s.v. Admiral]. The d in admiral probably came from a false imagination of connection with admirari.\n 1250. -- \"Li grand amiraus des galies m'envoia querre, et me demanda si j'estoie cousins le roy; et je le di que nanin . . . .\" -- Joinville, p. 178.

Malabar, i. 87) speaks of the amsam as a 'parish.'] It is further explained in the following quotation:-\n 1878. -- \"The amshom is really the smallest revenue division there is in Malabar, and is generally a tract of country some square miles in extent, in which there is no such thing as a village, but a series of scattered homesteads and farms, where the owner of the land and his servants reside . . . . separate and apart, in single separate huts, or in scattered collections of huts.\" -- Report of Census Com. in India.\n A MUCK, to run, v. There is we believe no room for doubt that, to us at least, this expression came from the Malay countries, where both the phrase and the practice are still familiar. Some valuable remarks on the phenomenon, as prevalent among the Malays, were contributed by Dr Oxley of Singapore to the Journal of the Indian Archipelago, vol. iii. p. 532; see a quotation below. [Mr W. W. Skeat writes -- \"The best explanation of the fact is perhaps that it was the Malay national method of committing suicide, especially as one never hears of Malays committing suicide in any other way. This form of suicide may arise from a wish to die fighting and thus avoid a 'straw death, a cow's death'; but it is curious that women and children are often among the victims, and especially members of the suicide's own family. The act of running amuck is probably due to causes over which the culprit has some amount of control, as the custom has now died out in the British Possessions in the Peninsula, the offenders probably objecting to being caught and tried in cold blood. I remember hearing of only about two cases (one by a Sikh soldier) in about six years. It has been suggested further that the extreme monotonous heat of the Peninsula may have conduced to such outbreaks as those of Running amuck and Latah.]\n The word is by Crawfurd ascribed to the Javanese, and this is his explanation:\n \"Amuk (J.). An a-muck; to run a-muck; to tilt; to run furiously and desperately at any one; to make a furious onset or charge in combat.\" -- (Malay Dict.) [The standard Malay, according to Mr Skeat, is rather amok (meng\u0101mok).]\n Marsden says that the word rarely occurs in any other than the verbal form meng\u0101muk, 'to make a furious attack' (Mem. of a Malayan Family, 96).\n There is reason, however, to ascribe an Indian origin to the term; whilst the practice, apart from the term, is of no rare occurrence in Indian history. Thus Tod records some notable instances in the history of the R\u0101jputs. In one of these (1634) the eldest son of the Raja of M\u0101rw\u0101r ran a-muck at the court of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, failing in his blow at the Emperor, but killing five courtiers of eminence before he fell himself. Again, in the 18th century, B\u012bjai Singh, also of M\u0101rw\u0101r, bore strong resentment against the T\u0101lpura prince of Hyderabad, B\u012bjar Kh\u0101n, who had sent to demand from the R\u0101jput tribute and a bride. A Bhatt\u012b and a Chond\u0101wat offered their services for vengeance, and set out for Sind as envoys. Whilst B\u012bjar Kh\u0101n read their credentials, muttering, 'No mention of the bride!' the Chond\u0101wat buried a dagger in his heart, exclaiming 'This for the bride!' 'And this for the tribute!' cried the Bhatt\u012b, repeating the blow. The pair then plied their daggers right and left, and 26 persons were slain before the envoys were hacked to pieces (Tod, ii. 45 & 315).\n But it is in Malabar that we trace the apparent origin of the Malay term in the existence of certain desperadoes who are called by a variety of old travellers amouchi or amuco. The nearest approach to this that we have been able to discover is the Malay\u0101lam amar-kkan, 'a warrior' (from amar, 'fight, war'). [The proper Malay\u0101lam term for such men was Chaver, literally those who took up or devoted themselves to death.] One of the special applications of this word is remarkable in connection with a singular custom in Malabar. After the Zamorin had reigned 12 years, a great assembly was held at Tirun\u0101v\u0101yi, when that Prince took his seat surrounded by his dependants, fully armed. Any one might then attack him, and the assailant, if successful in killing the Zamorin, got the throne. This had often happened. [For a full discussion of this custom see Frazer, Golden Bough, 2nd ed., ii. 14 sq.] In 1600 thirty such assailants were killed in the enterprise. Now these men were called amar-kk\u0101r (pl. of amar-kkan, see Gundert s.v.). These men evidently ran a-muck in the true Malay sense; and quotations below will show other illustrations from Malabar which confirm the idea that both name and practice originated in Continental India. There is indeed a difficulty as to the derivation here indicated, in the fact that the amuco or amouchi of European writers on Malabar seems by no means close enough to amarkkan, whilst it is so close to the Malay \u0101muk; and on this further light may be hoped for. The identity between the amoucos of Malabar and the amuck runners of the Malay peninsula is clearly shown by the passage from Correa given below. [Mr Whiteway adds \"Gouvea (1606) in his Iornada (ch. 9, Bk. ii.) applies the word amouques to certain Hindus whom he saw in S. Malabar near Quilon, whose duty it was to defend the Syrian Christians with their lives. There are reasons for thinking that the worthy priest got hold of the story of a cock and a bull; but in any case the Hindus referred to were really Jangadas.\"] (See JANCADA).\n De Gubernatis has indeed suggested that the word amouchi was derived from the Skt. amokshya, 'that cannot be loosed'; and this would be very consistent with several of the passages which we shall quote, in which the idea of being 'bound by a vow' underlies the conduct of the persons to whom the term was applicable both in Malabar and in the Archipelago. But amokshya is a word unknown to Malay\u0101lam, in such a sense at least.\n We have seen a-muck derived from the Ar. a\u1e25ma\u1e33, 'fatuous' [(e.g. Ball, Jungle Life, 358).] But this is etymology of the kind which scorns history.\n The phrase has been thoroughly naturalised in England since the days of Dryden and Pope. [The earliest quotation for \"running amuck\" in the N.E.D. is from Marvell (1672).]\n c. 1430. -- Nicolo Conti, speaking of the greater Islands of the Archipelago under the name of the Two Javas, does not use the word, but describes a form of the practice:-\n \"Homicide is here a jest, and goes without punishment. Debtors are made over to their creditors as slaves; and some of these, preferring death to slavery, will with drawn swords rush on, stabbing all whom they fall in with of less strength than themselves, until they meet death at the hands of some one more than a match for them. This man, the creditors then sue in Court for the dead man's debt.\" -- In India in the XVth C. 45.\n 1516. -- \"There are some of them (Javanese) who if they fall ill of any severe illness vow to God that if they remain in health they will of their own accord seek another more honourable death for his service, and as soon as they get well they take a dagger in their hands, and go out into the streets and kill as many persons as they meet, both men, women, and children, in such wise that they go like mad dogs, killing until they are killed. These are called Amuco. And as soon as they see them begin this work, they cry out, saying Amuco, Amuco, in order that people may take care of themselves, and they kill them with dagger and spear thrusts.\" -- Barbosa, Hak. Soc. 194. This passage seems to show that the word amuk must have been commonly used in Malay countries before the arrival of the Portuguese there, c. 1511.\n 1539. -- \" . . . The Tyrant (o Rey Ache) sallied forth in person, accompanied with 5000 resolute men (cinco mil Amoucos) and charged the Bataes very furiously.\" -- Pinto (orig. cap. xvii.) in Cogan, p. 20.\n 1552. -- De Barros, speaking of the capture of the Island of Beth (Beyt, off the N.W. point of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r) by Nuno da Cunha in 1531, says: \"But the natives of Guzarat stood in such fear of Sultan Badur that they would not consent to the terms. And so, like people determined on death, all that night they shaved their heads (this is a superstitious practice of those who despise life, people whom they call in India Amaucos) and betook themselves to their mosque, and there devoted their persons to death . . . . and as an earnest of this vow, and an example of this resolution, the Captain ordered a great fire to be made, and cast into it his wife, and a little son that he had, and all his household and his goods, in fear lest anything of his should fall into our possession.\" Others did the like, and then they fell upon the Portuguese. -- Dec. IV. iv. 13.\n c. 1561. -- In war between the Kings of Calicut and Cochin (1503) two princes of Cochin were killed. A number of these desperadoes who have been spoken of in the quotations were killed. . . . \"But some remained who were not killed, and these went in shame, not to have died avenging their lords . . . . these were more than 200, who all, according to their custom, shaved off all their hair, even to the eyebrows, and embraced each other and their friends and relations, as men about to suffer death. In this case they are as madmen -- known as amoucos -- and count themselves as already among the dead. These men dispersed, seeking wherever they might find men of Calicut, and among these they rushed fearless, killing and slaying till they were slain. And some of them, about twenty, reckoning more highly of their honour, desired to turn their death to better account; and these separated, and found their way secretly to Calicut, determined to slay the king. But as it became known that they were amoucos, the city gave the alarm, and the King sent his servants to slay them as they slew others. But they like desperate men played the devil (fazia\u0303o diabruras) before they were slain, and killed many people, with women and children. And five of them got together to a wood near the city, which they haunted for a good while after, making robberies and doing much mischief, until the whole of them were killed.\" -- Correa, i. 364-5.\n 1566. -- \"The King of Cochin . . . . . hath a great number of gentlemen which he calleth Amocchi, and some are called Nairi: these two sorts of men esteem not their lives anything, so that it may be for the honour of their King.\" -- M.

Malabar, i. 138.]\n 1584. -- \"Their forces (in Cochin) consist in a kind of soldiers whom they call amocchi, who are under obligation to die at the King's pleasure, and all soldiers who in war lose their King or their general lie under this obligation.

D. of Tuscany, in De Gubernatis, 154.\n c. 1584. -- \"There are some also who are called Amocchi . . . . who being weary of living, set themselves in the way with a weapon in their hands, which they call a Crise, and kill as many as they meete with, till somebody killeth them; and this they doe for the least anger they conceive, as desperate men.\" -- G. Balbi in Purchas, ii. 1724.\n 1602. -- De Couto, speaking of the Javanese: \"They are chivalrous men, and of such determination that for whatever offence may be offered them they make themselves amoucos in order to get satisfaction thereof.

IV. iii. 1.\n \" In another passage (ib. vii. 14) De Couto speaks of the amoucos of Malabar just as Della Valle does below. In Dec. VI. viii. 8 he describes how, on the death of the King of Pimenta, in action with the Portuguese, \"nearly 4000 Nairs made themselves amoucos with the usual ceremonies, shaving their heads on one side, and swearing by their pagoda to avenge the King's death.\"\n 1603. -- \"Este es el genero de milicia de la India, y los Reyes se\u00f1alan mas o menos Amoyos (\u00f2 Amacos, que todo es uno) para su guarda ordinaria.\" -- San Roman,Historia, 48.\n 1604. -- \"Auia hecho vna junta de Amocos, con sus ceremonias para venir a morir adonde el Panical auia sedo muerto.\"- Guerrero, Relacion, 91.\n 1611. -- \"Viceroy.

Again, in the Official Report prepared by the Brazilian Government for the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, we find: \"Of the genus Boa . . . . we may mention the .... sucuri\u00f9 or sucuriuba (B. anaconda), whose skins are used for boots and shoes and other purposes.\" And as the subject was engaging our attention we read the following in the St James' Gazette of April 3, 1882: -- \"A very unpleasant account is given by a Brazilian paper, the Voz do Povo of Diamantino, of the proceedings of a huge water-snake called the sucuruyu, which is to be found in some of the rivers of Brazil. . . . A slave, with some companions, was fishing with a net in the river, when he was suddenly seized by a sucuruyu, who made an effort with his hinder coils to carry off at the same time another of the fishing party.\" We had naturally supposed the name to be S. American, and its S. American character was rather corroborated by our finding in Ramusio's version of Pietro Martire d'Angheria such S. American names as Anacauchoa and Anacaona. Serious doubt was however thrown on the American origin of the word when we found that Mr H. W. Bates entirely disbelieved it, and when we failed to trace the name in any older books about S. America.\n In fact the oldest authority that we have met with, the famous John Ray, distinctly assigns the name, and the serpent to which the name properly belonged, to Ceylon. This occurs in his Synopsis Methodica Animalium Quadrupedum et Serpentini Generis, Lond. 1693. In this he gives a Cata logue of Indian Serpents, which he had received from his friend Dr Tancred Robinson, and which the latter had noted e Museo Leydensi. No. 8 in this list runs as follows:-\n \"8. Serpens Indicus Bubalinus, Anacandaia Zeylonensibus, id est Bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens,\" p. 332.\n The following passage from St Jerome, giving an etymology, right or wrong, of the word boa, which our naturalists now limit to certain great serpents of America, but which is often popularly applied to the pythons of E. Asia, shows a remarkable analogy to Ray's explanation of the name Anacandaia:-\n c. A.D. 395-400. -- \"Si quidem draco mirae magnitudinis, quos gentili sermone Boas vocant, ab eo quod tam grandes sint ut boves glutire soleant, omnem late vastabat provinciam, et non solum armenta et pecudes sed agricolas quoque et pastores tractos ad se vi spiritus absorbebat.\" -- In Vita Scti. Hilarionis Eremitae, Opera Scti. Eus. Hieron. Venetiis, 1767, ii. col. 35.\n Ray adds that on this No. 8 should be read what D. Cleyerus has said in the Ephem. German. An 12. obser. 7, entitled: De Serpente magno Indiae Orientalis Urobubalum deglutiente. The serpent in question was 25 feet long. Ray quotes in abridgment the description of its treatment of the buffalo; how, if the resistance is great, the victim is dragged to a tree, and compressed against it; how the noise of the crashing bones is heard as far as a cannon: how the crushed carcass is covered with saliva, etc. It is added that the country people (apparently this is in Amboyna) regard this great serpent as most desirable food.\n The following are extracts from Cleyer's paper, which is, more fully cited, Miscellanea Curiosa, sive Ephimeridum Medico-Physicarum Germanicarum Academiae Naturae Curiosorum, Dec. ii. -- Annus Secundus, Anni MDCLXXXIII. Norimbergae. Anno MDCLXXXIV. pp. 18-20. It is illustrated by a formidable but inaccurate picture showing the serpent seizing an ox (not a buffalo) by the muzzle, with huge teeth. He tells how he dissected a great snake that he bought from a huntsman in which he found a whole stag of middle age, entire in skin and every part; and another which contained a wild goat with great horns, likewise quite entire; and a third which had swallowed a porcupine armed with all his \"sagittiferis aculeis.\" In Amboyna a woman great with child had been swallowed by such a serpent. . . .\n \"Quod si animal quoddam robustius renitatur, ut spiris anguinis enecari non possit, serpens crebris cum animali convolutionibus cauda\u0302 sua\u0302 proximam arborem in auxilium et robur corporis arripit eamque circumdat, quo eo fortius et valentius gyris suis animal comprimere, suffocare, et demum enecare possit . . . .\"\n \"Factum est hoc modo, ut (quod ex fide dignissimis habeo) in Regno Aracan . . . . talis vasti corporis anguis prope flumen quoddam, cum Uro-bubalo, sive sylvestri bubalo aut uro . . . . immani spectaculo congredi visus fuerit, eumque dicto modo occiderit; quo conflictu et plusquam hostili amplexu fragor ossium in bubalo comminutorum ad distantiam tormenti bellici majoris . . . . a spectatoribus sat eminus stantibus exaudiri potuit. . . .\"\n The natives said these great snakes had poisonous fangs. These Cleyer could not find, but he believes the teeth to be in some degree venomous, for a servant of his scratched his hand on one of them. It swelled, greatly inflamed, and produced fever and delirium:\n \"Nec prius cessabant symptomata, quam Serpentinus lapis (see SNAKE - STONE) quam Patres Jesuitae hic componunt, vulneri adaptatus omne venenum extraheret, et ubique symptomata convenientibus antidotis essent profligata.\"\n Again, in 1768, we find in the Scots Magazine, App. p. 673, but quoted from \"London pap. Aug. 1768,\" and signed by R. Edwin, a professed eyewitness, a story with the following heading: \"Description of the Anaconda, a monstrous species of serpent. In a letter from an English gentleman, many years resident in the Island of Ceylon in the East Indies. . . . . The Ceylonese seem to know the creature well; they call it Anaconda, and talked of eating its flesh when they caught it.\" He describes its seizing and disposing of an enormous \"tyger.\" The serpent darts on the \"tyger\" from a tree, attacking first with a bite, then partially crushing and dragging it to the tree . . . . \"winding his body round both the tyger and the tree with all his violence, till the ribs and other bones began to give way . . . . each giving a loud crack when it burst . . . . the poor creature all this time was living, and at every loud crash of its bones gave a houl, not loud, yet piteous enough to pierce the cruelest heart.\"\n Then the serpent drags away its victim, covers it with slaver, swallows it, etc. The whole thing is very cleverly told, but is evidently a romance founded on the description by \"D. Cleyerus,\" which is quoted by Ray. There are no tigers in Ceylon. In fact, \"R. Edwin\" has developed the Romance of the Anaconda out of the description of D. Cleyerus, exactly as \"Mynheer F\u00f6rsch\" some years later developed the Romance of the Upas out of the older stories of the poison tree of Macassar. Indeed, when we find \"Dr Andrew Cleyer\" mentioned among the early relators of these latter stories, the suspicion becomes strong that both romances had the same author, and that \"R. Edwin\" was also the true author of the wonderful story told under the name of Foersch. (See further under UPAS.)\n In Percival's Ceylon (1803) we read: \"Before I arrived in the island I had heard many stories of a monstrous snake, so vast in size as to devour tigers and buffaloes, and so daring as even to attack the elephant\" (p. 303). Also, in Pridham's Ceylon and its Dependencies (1849, ii. 750 - 51): \"Pimbera or Anaconda is of the genus Python, Cuvier, and is known in English as the rock-snake.\" Emerson Tennent (Ceylon, 4th ed., 1860, i. 196) says: \"The great python (the 'boa' as it is commonly designated by Europeans, the 'anaconda' of Eastern story) which is supposed to crush the bones of an elephant, and to swallow a tiger\" . . . . It may be suspected that the letter of \"R. Edwin\" was the foundation of all or most of the stories alluded to in these passages. Still we have the authority of Ray's friend that Anaconda, or rather Anacondaia, was at Leyden applied as a Ceylonese name to a specimen of this python. The only interpretation of this that we can offer is Tamil \u0101nai - kondra [\u0101\u1e47aikk\u00f3n\u1e0da], \"which killed an elephant\"; an appellative, but not a name. We have no authority for the application of this appellative to a snake, though the passages quoted from Percival, Pridham, and Tennent are all suggestive of such stories, and the interpretation of the name anacondaia given to Ray: \"Bubalorum . . . membra conterens,\" is at least quite analogous as an appellative. It may be added that in Malay anakanda signifies \"one that is well-born,\" which does not help us. . . [Mr Skeat is unable to trace the word in Malay, and rejects the derivation from anakanda given above. A more plausible explanation is that given by Mr D. Ferguson (8 Ser. N. & Q. xii. 123), who derives anacandaia from Singhalese Henakandaya\u0302 (hena, 'lightning'; kanda, 'stem, trunk,') which is a name for the whipsnake (Passerita mycterizans), the name of the smaller reptile being by a blunder transferred to the greater. It is at least a curious coincidence that Ogilvy (1670) in his \"Description of the African Isles\" (p. 690), gives: \"Anakandef, a sort of small snakes,\" which is the Malagasy Anakand\u00eefy, 'a snake.']\n 1859. -- \"The skins of anacondas offered at Bangkok come from the northern provinces. \" -- D. O. King, in J. R. G. Soc., xxx. 184.\n", "ananas": "s. The Pine-apple (Ananassa sativa, Lindl.; Bromelia Ananas, L.), a native of the hot regions of Mexico and Panama. It abounded, as a cultivated plant, in Hispaniola and all the islands according to Oviedo. The Brazilian Nana, or perhaps Nanas, gave the Portuguese Ananas or Ananaz. This name has, we believe, accompanied the fruit whithersoever, except to England, it has travelled from its home in America. A pine was brought home to Charles V., as related by J. D'Acosta below. The plant is stated to have been first, in Europe, cultivated at Leyden about 1650 (?). In England it first fruited at Richmond, in Sir M. Decker's garden, in 1712.* But its diffusion in the East was early and rapid. To one who has seen the hundreds of acres covered with pineapples on the islands adjoining Singapore, or their profusion in a seemingly wild state in the valleys of the Kasia country on the eastern borders of The English Cyclop. states on the authority of the Sloane MSS. that the pine was brought into England by the Earl of Portland, in 1690. [See Encyl. Brit., 9th ed., xix. 106.]\n Bengal, it is hard to conceive of this fruit as introduced in modern times from another hemisphere. But, as in the case of tobacco, the name bewrayeth its true origin, whilst the large natural family of plants to which it belongs is exclusively American. The names given by Oviedo, probably those of Hispaniola, are Iaiama as a general name, and Boniana and Aiagua for two species. Pine-apples used to cost a pardao (a coin difficult to determine the value of in those days) when first introduced in Malabar, says Linschoten, but \"now there are so many grown in the country, that they are good cheape\" (91); [Hak. Soc. ii. 19]. Athanasius Kircher, in the middle of the 17th century, speaks of the ananas as produced in great abundance in the Chinese provinces of Canton, Kiangsu and Fuhkien. In Ibn Muhammad Wali's H. of the Conquest of Assam, written in 1662, the pine-apples of that region are commended for size and flavour. In the last years of the preceding century Carletti (1599) already commends the excellent ananas of Malacca. But even some 20 or 30 years earlier the fruit was grown profusely in W. India, as we learn from Chr. d'Acosta (1578). And we know from the \u0100\u012bn that (about 1590) the ananas was habitually served at the table of Akbar, the price of one being reckoned at only 4 dams, or 1\u204410 of a rupee; whilst Akbar's son Jah\u0101ng\u012br states that the fruit came from the sea-ports in the possession of the Portuguese. -- (See \u0100\u012bn, i. 66-68.)\n In Africa too, this royal fruit has spread, carrying the American name along with it. \"The M\u0101n\u0101n\u0101zi\u2020 or pine-apple,\" says Burton, \"grows luxuriantly as far as 3 marches from the coast (of Zanzibar). It is never cultivated, nor have its qualities as a fibrous plant been discovered.\" (J.R.G.S. xxix. 35). On the Ile Ste Marie, of Madagascar, it grew in the first half of the 17th century as manasse (Flacourt, 29).\n Abul Fazl, in the \u0100\u012bn, mentions that the fruit was also called ka\u1e6dhal-isafar\u012b, or 'travel jack-fruit,' \"because young plants put into a vessel may be taken on travels and will yield fruits.\" This seems a nonsensical pre M is here a Su\u0101hili prefix. See Bleek's Comp. Grammar, 189.\n text for the name, especially as another American fruit, the Guava, is sometimes known in Bengal as the Safar\u012b\u0101m, or 'travel mango.' It has been suggested by one of the present writers that these cases may present an uncommon use of the word safar\u012b in the sense of 'foreign' or 'outlandish,' just as Clusius says of the pine-apple in India, \"peregrinus est hic fructus,\" and as we begin this article by speaking of the ananas as having 'travelled' from its home in S. America. In the Tesoro of Cobarruvias (1611) we find \"\u00c7afari, cosa de Africa o Argel, como grenada\" ('a thing from Africa or Algiers, such as a pomegranate'). And on turning to Dozy and Eng. we find that in Saracenic Spain a renowned kind of pomegranate was called romm\u0101n safar\u012b: though this was said to have its name from a certain Safar ibnObaid al Kil\u0101i, who grew it first. One doubts here, and suspects some connection with the Indian terms, though the link is obscure. The lamented Prof. Blochmann, however, in a note on this suggestion, would not admit the possibility of the use of safar\u012b for 'foreign.' He called attention to the possible analogy of the Ar. safarjal for 'quince.' [Another suggestion may be hazarded. There is an Ar. word, \u0101s\u0101f\u012briy, which the dicts. define as 'a kind of olive.' Burton (Ar. Nights, iii. 79) translates this as 'sparrow-olives,' and says that they are so called because they attract sparrows (\u0101s\u0101f\u012br). It is perhaps possible that this name for a variety of olive may have been transferred to the pine-apple, and on reaching India, have been connected by a folk etymology with safar\u012b applied to a 'travelled' fruit.] In Macassar, according to Crawfurd, the ananas is called Pandang, from its strong external resemblance, as regards fruit and leaves, to the Pandanus. Conversely we have called the latter screw-pine, from its resemblance to the ananas, or perhaps to the pine-cone, the original owner of the name. Acosta again (1578) describes the Pandanus odoratissima as the 'wild ananas,' and in Malay\u0101lam the pine-apple is called by a name meaning 'pandanus-jackfruit.'\n The term ananas has been Arabized, among the Indian pharmacists at least, as 'a\u012bn-un-n\u0101s 'the eye of man'; in Burmese nan-na-si, and in Singhalese and Tamil as ann\u0101si (see Moodeen Sheriff).\n We should recall attention to the fact that pine-apple was good English long before the discovery of America, its proper meaning being what we have now been driven (for the avoiding of confusion) to call a pine-cone. This is the only meaning of the term 'pine-apple' in Minsheu's Guide into Tongues (2nd ed. 1627). And the ananas got this name from its strong resemblance to a pine-cone. This is most striking as regards the large cones of the Stone-Pine of S. Europe. In the following three first quotations 'pine-apple' is used in the old sense:\n 1563. -- \"To all such as die so, the people erecteth a chappell, and to each of them a pillar and pole made of Pine-apple for a perpetuall monument.\" -- Reports of Japan, in Hakl. ii. 567.\n \" \"The greater part of the quadrangle set with savage trees, as Okes, Chesnuts, Cypresses, Pine-apples, Cedars.\"- Reports of China, tr. by R. Willes, in Hakl. ii. 559.\n 1577. -- \"In these islandes they found no trees knowen vnto them, but Pine-apple trees, and Date trees, and those of marueylous heyght, and exceedyng hard\u00e9.\" -- Peter Martyr, in Eden's H. of Trauayle, fol. 11.\n Oviedo, in H. of the (Western) Indies, fills 2\u00bd folio pages with an enthusiastic description of the pine-apple as first found in Hispaniola, and of the reason why it got this name (pina in Spanish, pigna in Ramusio's Italian, from which we quote). We extract a few fragments. \n 1535. -- \"There are in this iland of Spagnuolo certain thistles, each of which bears a Pigna, and this is one of the most beautiful fruits that I have seen. . . . It has all these qualities in combination, viz. beauty of aspect, fragrance of colour, and exquisite flavour. The Christians gave it the name it bears (Pigna) because it is, in a manner, like that. But the pine-apples of the Indies of which we are speaking are much more beautiful than the pigne [i.e. pine-cones] of Europe, and have nothing of that hardness which is seen in those of Castile, which are in fact nothing but wood,\" &c. -- Ramusio, iii. f. 135 v.\n 1564. -- \"Their pines be of the bigness of two fists, the outside whereof is of the making of a pine-apple [i.e. pine-cone], but it is softe like the rinde of a cucomber, and the inside eateth like an apple, but it is more delicious than any sweet apple sugared.\" -- Master John Hawkins, in Hakl. iii. 602.\n 1575. -- \"Aussi la plus part des Sauuages s'en nourrissent vne bonne partie de l'ann\u00e9e, comme aussi ils font d'vne autre espece de fruit, nom\u00e9 Nana, qui est gros come vne moyenne citrouille, et fait autour comme vne pomme de pin. . . .\" -- A.

W.Montagu, Letter XIX.\n 1727. --  \"Oft in humble station dwells Unboastful worth, above fastidious pomp; Witness, thou best Anana, thou the pride Of vegetable life, beyond whate'er The poets imaged in the golden age.\" Thomson, Summer.\n The poet here gives the word an unusual form and accent.\n c. 1730. -- \"They (the Portuguese) cultivate the skirts of the hills, and grow the best products, such as sugar-cane, pineapples, and rice.\" -- Kh\u0101f\u012b Kh\u0101n, in Elliot, vii. 345.\n A curious question has been raised regarding the ananas, similar to that discussed under CUSTARD-APPLE, as in the existence of the pine-apple to the Old World, before the days of Columbus.\n In Prof. Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies (i. 578), it is stated in reference to ancient Assyria: \"Fruits . . . . were highly prized; amongst those of most repute were pomegranates, grapes, citrons, and apparently pineapples. \" A foot-note adds: \"The representation is so exact that I can hardly doubt the pine-apple being intended. Mr Layard expresses himself on this point with some hesitation (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 338).\" The cut given is something like the conventional figure of a pine-apple, though it seems to us by no means very exact as such. Again, in Winter Jones's tr. of Conti (c. 1430) in India in the 15th Century, the traveller, speaking of a place called Panconia (read Pauconia apparently Pegu) is made to say: \"they have pine-apples, oranges, chestnuts, melons, but small and green, white sandal-wood and camphor.\"\n We cannot believe that in either place the object intended was the Ananas, which has carried that American name with it round the world. Whatever the Assyrian representation was intended for, Conti seems to have stated, in the words pinus habent (as it runs in Poggio's Latin) merely that they had pine-trees. We do not understand on what ground the translator introduced pine-apples. If indeed any fruit was meant, it might have been that of the screw-pine, which though not eaten might perhaps have been seen in the bazars of Pegu, as it is used for some economical purposes. But pinus does not mean a fruit at all. 'Pine-cones' even would have been expressed by pineas or the like. [A reference to Mr L. W. King was thus answered: \"The identity of the tree with the date-palm is, I believe, acknowledged by all naturalists who have studied the trees on the Assyrian monuments, and the 'cones' held by the winged figures have obviously some connection with the trees. I think it was Prof. Tylor of Oxford (see Academy, June 8, 1886, p. 283) who first identified the ceremony with the fertilization of the palm, and there is much to be said for his suggestion. The date-palm was of very great use to the Babylonians and Assyrians, for it furnished them with food, drink, and building materials, and this fact would explain the frequent repetition on the Assyrian monuments of the ceremony of fertilisation. On the other hand, there is no evidence, so far as I know, that the pine-apple was extensively grown in Assyria.\" Also see Maspero, Dawn of Civ. 556 seq.; on the use of the pinecone in Greece, Fraser, Pausanias, iii. 65.]\n", "anchediva": "n.p. A small island off the W. coast of India, a little S. of Carwar, which is the subject of frequent and interesting mention in the early narratives. The name is interpreted by Malay\u0101lim as a\u00f1ju-d\u012bvu, 'Five Islands,' and if this is correct belongs to the whole group. This may, however, be only an en deavour to interpret an old name, which is perhaps traceable in *)AIGIDI/WN *NH=SOS of Ptolemy. It is a remarkable example of the slovenliness of English professional map-making that Keith Johnston's Royal Atlas map of India contains no indication of this famous island. [The Times Atlas and Constable's Hand Atlas also ignore it.] It has, between land surveys and seacharts, been omitted altogether by the compilers. But it is plain enough in the Admiralty charts; and the way Mr Birch speaks of it in his translation of Alboquerque as an \"Indian seaport, no longer marked on the maps,\" is odd (ii. 168).\n c. 1345. -- Ibn Batuta gives no name, but Anjediva is certainly the island of which he thus speaks: \"We left behind us the island (of Sind\u0101b\u016br or Goa), passing close to it, and cast anchor by a small island near the mainland, where there was a temple, with a grove and a reservoir of water.

Moreover they found, just beyond the church, a tanque of wrought ashlar, in which we took as much water as we wanted; and at the top of the whole island stood a great tanque of the depth of 4 fathoms, and moreover we found in front of the church a beach where we careened the ship.\" -- Roteiro, 95.\n 1510. -- \"I quitted this place, and went to another island which is called Anzediva. . .

But still, as so often is the case, comes in another word to create perplexity. For andas is, in Port., a bier or a litter, appearing in Bluteau as a genuine Port. word, and the use of which by the writer of the Roteiro quoted below shows that it is so indeed. And in defining Andor the same lexicographer says: \"A portable vehicle in India, in those regions where they do not use beasts, as in Malabar and elsewhere. It is a kind of contrivance like an uncovered Andas, which men bear on their shoulders, &c. . . . Among us Andor is a machine with four arms in which images or reliques of the saints are borne in processions.\" This last term is not, as we had imagined an old Port. word. It is Indian, in fact Sanskrit, hindola, 'a swing, a swinging cradle or hammock,' whence also Mahr. hin\u1e0dol\u0101, and H. hin\u1e0dol\u0101 or han\u1e0dol\u0101. It occurs, as will be seen, in the old Ar. work about Indian wonders, published by MM. Van der Lith and Marcel Devic. [To this Mr Skeat adds that in Malay andor means 'a buffalo-sledge for carting rice,' &c. It would appear to be the same as the Port. word, though it is hard to say which is the original.]\n 1013. -- \"Le m\u00eame m'a cont\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 S\u00e9- rend\u00eeb, les rois et ceux qui se comportent \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on des rois, se font porter dans le handoul (hand\u016bl) qui est semblable \u00e0 une liti\u00e8re, soutenu sur les \u00e9paules de quelques pi\u00e9tons.\" -- Kit\u0101b' Aj\u0101\u012bb-al Hind, p. 118.\n 1498. -- \"After two days had passed he (the Catual [Cotwal]) came to the factory in an andor which men carried on their shoulders, and these (andors) consist of great canes which are bent overhead and arched, and from these are hung certain cloths of a half fathom wide, and a fathom and a half long, and at the ends are pieces of wood to bear the cloth which hangs from the cane; and laid over the cloth there is a great mattrass of the same size, and this all made of silk-stuff wrought with gold-thread, and with many decorations and fringes and tassels; whilst the ends of the cane are mounted with silver, all very gorgeous, and rich, like the lords who travel so.\"- Correa, i. 102.\n 1498. -- \"Alii trouveram ao capitam mor humas andas d'omeens em que os onrrados, custumam em a quella terra d'andar, e alguns mercadores se as querem ter pagam por ello a elrey certa cousa.\" -- Roteiro, pp. 54-55.

There is no coin of one anna only, so that it is a money of account only.

A well-known wharf at Bombay. A street near it is called Apollo Street, and a gate of the Fort leading to it 'the Apollo Gate.'

The quotations given afford different suggestions, and Dr Wilson's dictum is entitled to respect, though we do not know what p\u0101law\u0101 here means. Sir G. Birdwood writes that it used to be said in Bombay, that Apollobandar was a corr. of palwa-bandar, because the pier was the place where the boats used to land palwa fish. But we know of no fish so called; it is however possible that the palla or Sable-fish (Hilsa) is meant, which is so called in Bombay, as well as in Sind. [The \u0100\u012bn (ii. 338) speaks of \"a kind of fish called palwah which comes up into the Indus from the sea, unrivalled for its fine and exquisite flavour,\" which is the Hilsa.] On the other hand we may observe that there was at Calcutta in 1748 a frequented tavern called the Apollo (see Long, p. 11). And it is not impossible that a house of the same name may have given its title to the Bombay street and wharf. But Sir Michael Westropp's quotation below shows that Pallo was at least the native representation of the name more than 150 years ago. We may add that a native told Mr W. G.

India to those distilled from the fermented sap of sundry palms; in E. and N. India to the spirit distilled from cane-molasses, and also to that from rice. The Turkish form of the word, r\u0101\u1e33i, is applied to a spirit made from grape-skins; and in Syria and Egypt to a spirit flavoured with aniseed, made in the Lebanon. There is a popular or slang Fr. word, riquiqui, for brandy, which appears also to be derived from ara\u1e33\u012b (Marcel Devic).

Hyde derives it from tars-kh\u0101nah, 'domus terroris,' contracted into tars\u0101nah, the form (as he says) used at Constantinople (Syntagma Dissertt., i. 100). But it is really the Ar. d\u0101r-al-\u1e63in\u0101'a, 'domus artificii,' as the quotations from Mas'\u016bd\u012b clearly show. The old Ital. forms darsena, darsinale corroborate this, and the Sp. atara\u00e7ana, which is rendered in Ar. by Pedro de Alcala, quoted by Dozy, as dar a cinaa. -- (See details in Dozy, Oosterlingen, 16-18.)\n A.D. 943-4. -- \"At this day in the year of the Hijra 332, Rhodes (Rodas) is an arsenal (d\u0101r-\u1e63in\u0101'a) where the Greeks build their war-vessels.\" -- Mas'\u016bd\u012b, ii. 423.

T., 81 82 [ed. Constable, 254].\n", "artichoke": "s. The genealogy of this word appears to be somewhat as follows: The Ar. is al-\u1e25arsh\u016bf (perhaps connected with \u1e25arash, 'roughskinned') or al-kharsh\u016bf; hence Sp. alcarchofa and It. carcioffo and arciocco, Fr. artichaut, Eng. artichoke.\n c. 1348. -- \"The Incense (benzoin) tree is small . . . . its branches are like those of a thistle or an artichoke (al-kharshaf).\" -- Ibn Batuta, iv. 240.

Skt. \u0100rya, 'noble.' A term frequently used to include all the races (Indo-Persic, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Sclavonic, &c.) which speak languages belonging to the same family as Sanskrit. Much vogue was given to the term by Pictet's publication of Les Origines Indo-Europ\u00e9ennes, ou les Aryas Primitifs (Paris, 1859), and this writer seems almost to claim the name in this sense as his own (see quotation below). But it was in use long before the date of his book. Our first quotation is from Ritter, and there it has hardly reached the full extent of application. Ritter seems to have derived the use in this passage from Lassen's Pentapotamia. The word has in great measure superseded the older term Indo-Germanic, proposed by F. Schlegel at the beginning of the last century. The latter is, however, still sometimes used, and M. Hovelacque, especially, prefers it. We may observe here that the connection which evidently exists between the several languages classed together as Aryan cannot be regarded, as it was formerly, as warranting an assumption of identity of race in all the peoples who speak them.\n It may be noted as curious that among the Javanese (a people so remote in blood from what we understand by Aryan), the word \u0101rya is commonly used as an honorary prefix to the names of men of rank; a survival of the ancient Hindu influence on the civilisation of the island.\n The earliest use of Aryan in an ethnic sense is in the Inscription on the tomb of Darius, in which the king calls himself an Aryan, and of Aryan descent, whilst Ormuzd is in the Median version styled, 'God of the Aryans'\n B.C. c. 486. -- \"Adam D\u00e1ryavush Khsh\u00e1yathiya vazarka . . . . . . . . . .

[Atap, according to Mr Skeat, is also applied to any roofing; thus tiles are called atap batu, 'stone ataps.'] The Nipa, \"although a wild plant, for it is so abundant that its culture is not necessary, it is remarkable that its name should be the same in all the languages from Sumatra to the Philippines. \" -- (Crawfurd, Dict.

An obsolete word for 'satin,' from the Ar. a\u1e6dlas, used in that sense, literally 'bare' or 'bald' (comp. the Ital. raso for 'satin'). The word is still used in German. [The Draper's Dict. (s.v.) says that \"a silk stuff wrought with threads of gold and silver, and known by this name, was at one time imported from India.\" Yusuf Ali (Mon. on Silk Fabrics, p. 93) writes: \"Atlas is the Indian satin, but the term satan (corrupted from the English) is also applied, and sometimes specialised to a thicker form of the fabric.

B. 1879.)\n", "atoll": "s. A group of coral islands forming a ring or chaplet, sometimes of many miles in diameter, inclosing a space of comparatively shallow water, each of the islands being on the same type as the atoll. We derive the expression from the Maldive islands, which are the typical examples of this structure, and where the form of the word is ato\u1e37u. [P. de Laval (Hak. Soc. i. 93) states that the provinces in the Maldives were known as Atollon.] It is probably connected with the Singhalese \u00e4tul, 'inside'; [or etula, as Mr Gray (P. de Laval, Hak. Soc. i. 94) writes the word. The Mad. Admin. Man. in the Glossary gives Malay\u0101l. att\u0101lam, 'a sinking reef']. The term was made a scientific one by Darwin in his publication on Coral Reefs (see below), but our second quotation shows that it had been generalised at an earlier date.\n c. 1610. -- \"Estant au milieu d'vn Atollon, vous voyez autour de vous ce grand banc de pierre que jay dit, qui environne et qui defend les isles contre l'impetuosit\u00e9 de la mer.\" -- Pyrard de Laval, i. 71 (ed. 1679); [Hak.

Ar. and thence H. '\u0101mil (noun of agency from 'amal, 'he performed a task or office,' therefore 'an agent'). Under the native governments a collector of Revenue; also a farmer of the Revenue invested with chief authority in his District. Also\n", "aumildar": ". Properly 'amald\u0101r, 'one holding office'; (Ar. 'amal, 'work,' with P. term of agency). A factor or manager. Among the Mahrattas the 'Amald\u0101r was a collector of revenue under varying conditions -- (See details in Wilson). The term is now limited to Mysore and a few other parts of India, and does not belong to the standard system of any Presidency. The word in the following passage looks as if intended for 'amald\u0101r, though there is a term M\u0101ld\u0101r, 'the holder of property.'\n 1680. -- \"The Mauldar or Didwan [Dewan] that came with the Ruccas [Roocka] from Golcondah sent forward to Lingappa at Conjiveram.\" -- Ft.

During the Company's trading days this term was applied to their factories for the purchase, on advances, of native piecegoods, &c.\n 1778. -- \". . . . Gentoo-factors in their own pay to provide the investments at the different Aurungs or cloth markets in the province.\" -- Orme, ii. 51.\n 1789. -- \"I doubt, however, very much whether he has had sufficient experience in the commercial line to enable him to manage so difficult and so limportant an aurung as Luckipore, which is almost the only one of any magnitude which supplies the species of coarse cloths which do not interfere with the British manufacture.\" -- Cornwallis. i. 435.\n", "ava": "n.p. The name of the city which was for several centuries the capital of the Burmese Empire, and was applied often to that State itself. This name is borrowed, according to Crawfurd, from the form Awa or Awak used by the Malays. The proper Burmese form was Eng-wa, or 'the Lake-Mouth,' because the city was built near the opening of a lagoon into the Irawadi; but this was called, even by the Burmese, more popularly A-w\u0101, 'The Mouth.' The city was founded A.D. 1364. The first European occurrence of the name, so far as we know, is (c. 1440) in the narrative of Nicolo Conti, and it appears again (no doubt from Conti's information) in the great World-Map of Fra Mauro at Venice (1459).\n c. 1430. -- \"Having sailed up this river for the space of a month he arrived at a city more noble than all the others, called Ava, and the circumference of which is 15 miles.\" -- Conti, in India in the X Vth Cent. 11.\n c. 1490. -- \"The country (Pegu) is distant 15 days' journey by land from another called Ava in which grow rubies and many other precious stones.\" -- Hier. di Sto.

(Chorom.) 127.\n", "avadavat": "s. Improperly for Amadavat. The name given to a certain pretty little cage-bird (Estrelda amandava, L. or 'Red Wax-Bill') found throughout India, but originally brought to Europe from Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d in Guzerat, of which the name is a corruption. We also find Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d represented by Madava: as in old maps Astar\u0101b\u0101d on the Caspian is represented by Strava (see quotation from Correa below).

Skt. Avat\u0101ra, an incarnation on earth of a divine Being. This word first appears in Baldaeus (1672) in the form Autaar (Afgoderye, p. 52), which in the German version generally quoted in this book takes the corrupter shape of Altar.\n [c. 1590. -- \"In the city of Sambal is a temple called Hari Mandal (the temple of Vishnu) belonging to a Brahman, from among whose descendants the tenth avatar will appear at this spot.\" -- \u0100\u012bn, tr.

Skeat derives this in all its senses from L. Latin averia, used for cattle; for his deduction of meanings we must refer to his Dictionary. But it is worthy of consideration whether average, in its special marine use for a proportionate contribution towards losses of those whose goods are cast into the sea to save a ship, &c., is not directly connected with the Fr. avarie, which has quite that signification. And this last Dozy shows most plausibly to be from the Ar. 'aw\u0101r, spoilt merchandise.' [This is rejected by the N.E.D., which concludes that the Ar. 'aw\u0101r is \"merely a mod. Arabic translation and adaptation of the Western term in its latest sense.\"] Note that many European words of trade are from the Arabic; and that avarie is in Dutch avarij, averij, or haverij. -- (See Dozy, Oosterlingen. )\n", "ayah": "s. A native lady's-maid or nurse-maid. The word has been adopted into most of the Indian vernaculars in the forms \u0101ya or \u0101y\u0101, but it is really Portuguese (f. aia, 'a nurse, or governess'; m. aio, 'the governor of a young noble').
