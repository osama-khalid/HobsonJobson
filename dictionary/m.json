Pimenta, in Purchas, iii. 1748.\n", "macareo": "s. A term applied by old voyagers to the phenomenon of the bore, or great tidal wave as seen especially in the Gulf of Cambay, and in the Sitang Estuary in Pegu. The word is used by them as if it were an Oriental word. At one time we were disposed to think it might be the Skt. word makara, which is applied to a mythological sea-monster, and to the Zodiacal sign Capricorn. This might easily have had a mythological association with the furious phenomenon in question, and several of the names given to it in various parts of the world seem due to associations of a similar kind. Thus the old English word Oegir or Eagre for the bore on the Severn, which occurs in Drayton, \"seems to be a reminiscence of the old Scandinavian deity Oegir, the god of the stormy sea.\"* [This theory is rejected by N.E.D. s.v. Eagre.] One of the Hindi names for the phenomenon is Men\u1e0dh\u0101, 'The Ram'; whilst in modern Guzerat, according to R. Drummond, the natives call it gho\u1e5b\u0101, \"likening it to the war horse, or a squadron of them.\"\u2020 But nothing could illustrate the naturalness of such a figure as makara, applied to the bore, better than the following paragraph in the review-article just quoted (p. 401), which was evidently penned without any allusion to or suggestion of such an See an interesting paper in the Saturday Review of Sept. 29, 1883, on Le Mascaret.\n Other names for the bore in India are: Hind. humm\u0101, and in Bengal b\u0101n.\n origin of the name, and which indeed makes no reference to the Indian name, but only to the French names of which we shall presently speak:\n \"Compared with what it used to be, if old descriptions may be trusted, the Mascaret is now stripped of its terrors. It resembles the great nature-force which used to ravage the valley of the Seine, like one of the mythical dragons which, as legends tell, laid whole districts waste, about as much as a lion confined in a cage resembles the free monarch of the African wilderness.\"\n Take also the following:\n 1885. -- \"Here at his mouth Father Meghna is 20 miles broad, with islands on his breast as large as English counties, and a great tidal bore which made a daily and evervarying excitement. . . . In deep water, it passed merely as a large rolling billow; but in the shallows it rushed along, roaring like a crested and devouring monster, before which no small craft could live.\" -- Lt.-Col. T. Lewin, A Fly on the Wheel, 161-162.\n But unfortunately we can find no evidence of the designation of the phenomenon in India by the name of makara or the like; whilst both mascaret (as indicated in the quotation just made) and macr\u00e9e are found in French as terms for the bore. Both terms appear to belong properly to the Garonne, though mascaret has of late began on the Seine to supplant the old term barre, which is evidently the same as our bore. [The N.E.D. suggests O. N. b\u00e1ra, 'wave.'] Littr\u00e9 can suggest no etymology for mascaret; he mentions a whimsical one which connects the word with a place on the Garrone called St. Macaire, but only to reject it. There would be no impossibility in the transfer of an Indian word of this kind to France, any more than in the other alternative of the transfer of a French term to India in such a way that in the 16th century visitors to that country should have regarded it as an indigenous word, if we had but evidence of its Indian existence. The date of Littr\u00e9's earliest quotation, which we borrow below, is also unfavourable to the probability of transplantation from India. There remains the possibility that the word is Basque. The Saturday Reviewer already quoted says that he could find nothing approaching to Mascaret in a Basque French Dict., but this hardly seems final.\n The vast rapidity of the flood-tide in the Gulf of Cambay is mentioned by Ma\u1e63'\u016bd\u012b, who witnessed it in the year H. 303 (A.D. 915) i. 255; also less precisely by Ibn Batuta (iv. 60). There is a paper on it in the Bo. Govt. Selections, N.S. No. xxvi., from which it appears that the bore wave reaches a velocity of 10\u00bd knots. [See also Forbes, Or. Mem. 2nd. ed. i. 313.]\n 1553. -- \"In which time there came hither (to Diu) a concourse of many vessels from the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and all the coast of Arabia and India, so that the places within the Gulf of Cambaya, which had become rich and noble by trade, were by this port undone.

[Mr. Skeat notes that here \"copang\" is Malay kupany; tale, tali; bancal, bongkal.]\n", "macheen": "n.p. This name, Mah\u0101-ch\u012bna, \"Great China,\" is one by which China was known in India in the early centuries of our era, and the term is still to be heard in India in the same sense in which AlBir\u016bn\u012b uses it, saying that all beyond the great mountains (Him\u0101laya) is Mah\u0101-ch\u012bn. But \"in later times the majority, not knowing the meaning of the expression, seem to have used it pleonastically coupled with Ch\u012bn, to denote the same thing, Ch\u012bn and M\u0101ch\u012bn, a phrase having some analogy to the way Sind and Hind was used to express all India, but a stronger one to Gog and Magog, as applied to the northern nations of Asia.\" And eventually Ch\u012bn was discovered to be the eldest son of Japhet, and M\u0101ch\u012bn his grandson; which is much the same as saying that Britain was the eldest son of Brut the Trojan, and Great Britain his grandson! (Cathay and the Way Thither, p. cxix.).\n In the days of the Mongol supremacy in China, when Chinese affairs were for a time more distinctly conceived in Western Asia, and the name of Manzi as denoting Southern China, unconquered by the Mongols till 1275, was current in the West, it would appear that this name was confounded with M\u0101ch\u012bn, and the latter thus acquired a specific but erroneous application. One author of the 16th century also (quoted by Klaproth, J. As. Soc. ser. 2, tom. i. 115) distinguishes Ch\u012bn and M\u0101ch\u012bn as N. and S. China, but this distinction seems never to have been entertained by the Hindus. Ibn Batuta sometimes distinguishes \u1e62\u012bn (i.e. Ch\u012bn) as South China from Khit\u0101i (see CATHAY) as North China. In times when intimacy with China had again ceased, the double name seems to have recovered its old vagueness as a rotund way of saying China, and had no more plurality of sense than in modern parlance Sodor and Man. But then comes an occasional new application of M\u0101ch\u012bn to Indo-China, as in Conti (followed by Fra Mauro). An exceptional application, arising from the Arab habit of applying the name of a country to the capital or the chief port frequented by them, arose in the Middle Ages, through which Canton became known in the West as the city of M\u0101ch\u012bn, or in Persian translation Ch\u012bnkal\u0101n, i.e. Great Ch\u012bn.\n Mah\u0101ch\u012bna as applied to China:\n 636. -- \"'In what country exists the kingdom of the Great Thang?' asked the king (S\u012bl\u0101ditya of Kanauj), 'how far is it from this?'\n \"'It is situated,' replied he (Hwen T'sang), 'to the N.E. of this kingdom, and is distant several ten-thousands of li.

It began about 1484, and in 1572 was merged in the kingdom of Ahmednagar.

This was a name given to certain heathen and superstitious practices which the Jesuits of the Madura, Carnatic, and Mysore Missions permitted to their converts, in spite of repeated prohibitions by the Popes. And though these practices were finally condemned by the Legate Cardinal de Tournon in 1704, they still subsist, more or less, among native Catholic Christians, and especially those belonging to the (socalled) Goa Churches. These practices are generally alleged to have arisen under Father de' Nobili (\"Robertus de Nobilibus\"), who came to Madura about 1606. There can be no doubt that the aim of this famous Jesuit was to present Christianity to the people under the form, as it were, of a Hindu translation!\n The nature of the practices of which we speak may be gathered from the following particulars of their prohibition. In 1623 Pope Gregory XV., by a constitution dated 31st January, condemned the following: -- 1. The investiture of Brahmans and certain other castes with the sacred thread, through the agency of Hindu priests, and with Hindu ceremonies. For these Christian ceremonies were to be substituted; and the thread was to be regarded as only a civil badge. 2. The ornamental use of sandalwood paste was permitted, but not its superstitious use, e.g., in mixture with cowdung ashes, &c., for ceremonial purification. 3. Bathing as a ceremonial purification. 4. The observance of caste, and the refusal of high-caste Christians to mix with lowcaste Christians in the churches was disapproved.\n The quarrels between Capuchins and Jesuits later in the 17th century again brought the Malabar Rites into notice, and Cardinal de Tournon was sent on his unlucky mission to determine these matters finally. His decree (June 23, 1704) prohibited: 1. A mutilated form of baptism, in which were omitted certain ceremonies offensive to Hindus, specifically the use of 'saliva, sal, et insufflatio.' 2. The use of Pagan names. 3. The Hinduizing of Christian terms by translation. 4. Deferring the baptism of children. 5. Infant marriages. 6. The use of the Hindu tali (see TALEE). 7. Hindu usages at marriages. 8. Augury at marriages, by means of a coco-nut. 9. The exclusion of women from churches during certain periods. 10. Ceremonies on a girl's attainment of puberty. 11. The making distinctions between Pariahs and others. 12. The assistance of Christian musicians at heathen ceremonies. 13. The use of ceremonial washings and bathings. 14. The use of cowdung-ashes. 15. The reading and use of Hindu books.\n With regard to No. 11 it may be observed that in South India the distinction of castes still subsists, and the only Christian Mission in that quarter which has really succeeded in abolishing caste is that of the Basel Society.\n", "malabathrum": "s. There can be very little doubt that this classical export from India was the dried leaf of various species of Cinnamomum, which leaf was known in Skt. as tam\u0101la-pattra. Some who wrote soon after the Portuguese discoveries took, perhaps not unnaturally, the p\u0101n or betel-leaf for the malabathrum of the ancients; and this was maintained by Dean Vincent in his well-known work on the Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients, justifying this in part by the Ar. name of the betel, tamb\u016bl, which is taken from Skt. t\u0101mb\u016bla, betel; t\u0101mb\u016bla-pattra, betel-leaf. The tam\u0101la-pattra, however, the produce of certain wild spp. of Cinnamomum, obtained both in the hills of Eastern Bengal and in the forests of Southern India, is still valued in India as a medicine and aromatic, though in no such degree as in ancient times, and it is usually known in domestic economy as tejp\u0101t, or corruptly tezp\u0101t, i.e. 'pungent leaf.' The leaf was in the Arabic Materia Medica under the name of s\u0101dhaj or s\u0101dhaj\u012b Hind\u012b, as was till recently in the English Pharmacop\u0153ia as Folium indicum, which will still be found in Italian drug-shops. The matter is treated, with his usual lucidity and abundance of local knowledge, in the Colloquios of Garcia de Orta, of which we give a short extract. This was evidently unknown to Dean Vincent, as he repeats the very errors which Garcia dissipates. Garcia also notes that confusion of Malabathrum and Folium indicum with spikenard, which is traceable in Pliny as well as among the Arab pharmacologists. The ancients did no doubt apply the name Malabathrum to some other substance, an unguent or solid extract. Rheede, we may notice, mentions that in his time in Malabar, oils in high medical estimation were made from both leaves and root of the \"wild cinnamon\" of that coast, and that from the root of the same tree a camphor was extracted, having several of the properties of real camphor and more fragrance. (See a note by one of the present writers in Cathay, &c., pp. cxlv.-xlvi.) The name Cinnamon is properly confined to the tree of Ceylon (C. Zeylanicum). The other Cinnamoma are properly Cassia barks.

The city which gives its name to the Peninsula and the Straits of Malacca, and which was the seat of a considerable Malay monarchy till its capture by the Portuguese under D'Alboquerque in 1511. One naturally supposes some etymological connection between Malay and Malacca. And such a connection is put forward by De Barros and D'Alboquerque (see below, and also under MALAY). The latter also mentions an alternative suggestion for the origin of the name of the city, which evidently refers to the Ar. mul\u0101\u1e33\u0101t, 'a meeting.' This last, though it appears also in the Sijara Malayu, may be totally rejected. Crawfurd is positive that the place was called from the word malaka, the Malay name of the Phyllanthus emblica, or emblic Myrobalan (q.v.), \"a tree said to be abundant in that locality\"; and this, it will be seen below, is given by Godinho de Eredia as the etymology. Malaka again seems to be a corruption of the Skt. amlaka, from amla, 'acid.' [Mr. Skeat writes: \"There can be no doubt that Crawfurd is right, and that the place was named from the tree. The suggested connection between Malayu and Malaka appears impossible to me, and, I think, would do so to any one acquainted with the laws of the language. I have seen the Malaka tree myself and eaten its fruit. Ridley in his Botanical Lists has laka-laka and malaka which he identifies as Phyllanthus emblica, L. and P. pectinatus Hooker (Euphorbiaceae). The two species are hardly distinct, but the latter is the commoner form. The fact is that the place, as is so often the case among the Malays, must have taken its name from the Sungei Malaka, or Malaka River.\"]\n 1416. -- \"There was no King but only a chief, the country belonging to Siam. . . .

Chicken maladoo is an article in the Anglo-Indian menu. It looks like a corruption from the French cuisine, but of what? [Maladoo or Manadoo, a lady informs me, is cold meat, such as chicken or mutton, cut into slices, or pounded up and re-cooked in batter. The Port. malhado, 'beaten-up,' has been suggested as a possible origin for the word.]\n", "malay": "n.p. This is in the Malay language an adjective, Mal\u0101yu; thus orang Mal\u0101yu, 'a Malay'; t\u0101na [t\u0101nah] Mal\u0101yu, 'the Malay country'; bah\u0101sa [bh\u0101sa] Mal\u0101yu, 'the Malay language.'\n In Javanese the word mal\u0101yu signifies 'to run away,' and the proper name has traditionally been derived from this, in reference to the alleged foundation of Malacca by Javanese fugitives; but we can hardly attach importance to this. It may be worthy at least of consideration whether the name was not of foreign, i.e. of S. Indian origin, and connected with the Mal\u0101ya of the Peninsula (see under MALABAR). [Mr. Skeat writes: \"The tradition given me by Javanese in the Malay States was that the name was applied to Javanese refugees, who peopled the S. of Sumatra. Whatever be the original meaning of the word, it is probable that it started its life history as a river-name in the S. of Sumatra, and thence became applied to the district through which the river ran, and so to the people who lived there; after which it spread with the Malay dialect until it included not only many allied, but also many foreign, tribes; all Malayspeaking tribes being eventually called Malays without regard to racial origin. A most important passage in this connection is to be found in Leyden's Tr. of the 'Malay Annals' (1821), p. 20, in which direct reference to such a river is made: 'There is a country in the land of Andal\u00e1s named Paralembang, which is at present denominated Palembang, the raja of which was denominated Damang Lebar Dawn (chieftain Broad-leaf), who derived his origin from Raja Sulan (Chulan?), whose great-grandson he was. The name of its river Muartatang, into which falls another river named Sungey Malayu, near the source of which is a mountain named the mountain Sagantang Maha Miru.' Here Palembang is the name of a well-known Sumatran State, often described as the original home of the Malay race. In standard Malay 'Damang Lebar Daun' would be 'De\u0306mang Lebar Daun.' Raja Chulan is probably some mythical Indian king, the story being evidently derived from Indian traditions. 'Muartatang' may be a mistake for Muar Tenang, which is a place one heard of in the Peninsula, though I do not know for certain where it is. 'Sungey Malayu' simply means 'River Malayu.' 'Sagantang Maha Miru' is, I think, a mistake for Sa-guntang Maha Miru, which is the name used in the Peninsula for the sacred central mountain of the world on which the episode related in the Annals occurred\" (see Skeat, Malay Magic, p. 2).]\n It is a remarkable circumstance, which has been noted by Crawfurd, that a name which appears on Ptolemy's Tables as on the coast of the Golden Chersonese, and which must be located somewhere about Maulmain, is *MALEOU= *KW=LON, words which in Javanese (Mal\u0101yu-Kulon) would signify \"Malays of the West.\" After this the next (possible) occurrence of the name in literature is in the Geography of Edrisi, who describes Malai as a great island in the eastern seas, or rather as occupying the position of the Lemuria of Mr. Sclater, for (in partial accommodation to the Ptolemaic theory of the Indian Sea) it stretched eastward nearly from the coast of Zinj, i.e. of Eastern Africa, to the vicinity of China. Thus it must be uncertain without further accounts whether it is an adumbration of the great Malay islands (as is on the whole probable) or of the Island of the Malagashes (Madagascar), if it is either. We then come to Marco Polo, and after him there is, we believe, no mention of the Malay name till the Portuguese entered the seas of the Archipelago.\n [A.D. 690. -- Mr. Skeat notes: \"I Tsing speaks of the 'Molo-yu country,' i.e. the district W. or N.W. of Palembang in Sumatra.\"]\n c. 1150. -- \"The Isle of Malai is very great. . . .

This is the name applied to one of the cultivated Dravidian languages, the closest in its relation to the Tamil. It is spoken along the Malabar coast, on the Western side of the Ghauts (or Mal\u0101ya mountains), from the Chandragiri River on the North, near Mangalore (entering the sea in 12\u02da 29'), beyond which the language is, for a limited distance, Tulu, and then Canarese, to Trevandrum on the South (lat. 8\u02da 29'), where Tamil begins to supersede it. Tamil, however, also intertwines with Malay\u0101lam all along Malabar. The term Malay\u0101lam properly applies to territory, not language, and might be rendered \"Mountain region\" [See under MALABAR, and Logan, Man. of Malabar, i. 90.]\n", "maldives": "n.p. The proper form of this name appears to be Male-d\u012bva; not, as the estimable Garcia de Orta says, Nale-d\u012bva; whilst the etymology which he gives is certainly wrong, hard as it may be to say what is the right one. The people of the islands formerly designated themselves and their country by a form of the word for 'island' which we have in the Skt. dv\u012bpa and the Pali d\u012bpo. We find this reflected in the Divi of Ammianus, and in the D\u012bva and D\u012bba-j\u0101t (Pers. plural) of old Arab geographers, whilst it survives in letters of the 18th century addressed to the Ceylon Government (Dutch) by the Sultan of the Isles, who calls his kingdom Divehi Rajj\u00e9, and his people Divehe m\u012bhun. Something like the modern form first appears in Ibn Batuta. He, it will be seen, in his admirable account of these islands, calls them, as it were, Mahal-dives, and says they were so called from the chief group Mahal, which was the residence of the Sultan, indicating a connection with Mahal, 'a palace.' This form of the name looks like a foreign 'striving after meaning.' But Pyrard de Laval, the author of the most complete account in existence, also says that the name of the islands was taken from Mal\u00e9, that on which the King resided. Bishop Caldwell has suggested that these islands were the dives, or islands, of Mal\u00e9, as Maleb\u0101r (see MALABAR) was the coast-tract or continent, of Mal\u00e9. It is, however, not impossible that the true etymology was from m\u0101l\u0101, 'a garland or necklace,' of which their configuration is highly suggestive. [The Madras Gloss. gives Malay\u0101l. m\u0101l, 'black,' and dv\u012bpa, 'island,' from the dark soil. For a full account of early notices of the Maldives, see Mr. Gray's note on Pyrard de Laval, Hak. Soc. ii. 423 seqq.] Milburn (Or.

And that is that the right name is not Maldiva, but Nalediva; for nale in Malabar means 'four,' and diva 'island,' so that in the Malabar tongue the name is as much as to say 'Four Isles.' . . . And in the same way we call a certain island that is 12 leagues from Goa Angediva (see ANCHEDIVA), because there are five in the group, and so the name in Malabar means 'Five Isles,' for ange is 'five.'

The word is Ar. mu'allim, literally 'the Instructor, ' and is properly applied to the pilot or sailing-master. The word may be compared, thus used, with our 'master' in the Navy. In regard to the first quotation we may observe that N\u0101khuda (see NACODA) is, rather than Mu'allim, 'the captain'; though its proper meaning is the owner of the ship; the two capacities of owner and skipper being doubtless often combined. The distinction of Mu'allim from N\u0101khuda accounts for the former title being assigned to the mate.\n 1497. -- \"And he sent 20 cruzados in gold, and 20 testoons in silver for the Malemos, who were the pilots; for of these coins he would give each month whatever he (the Sheikh) should direct.\" -- Correa, i. 38 (E.T. by Ld.

Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger describe it as the rhizome of Coptis Teeta, Wallich, t\u012bta being the name of the drug in the Mishmi country at the head of the Assam Valley, from which it is imported into Bengal.

Mandarij, Mandarim. Wedgwood explains and derives the word thus: \"A Chinese officer, a name first made known to us by the Portuguese, and like the Indian caste, erroneously supposed to be a native term. From Portuguese mandar, to hold authority, command, govern, &c.\" So also T. Hyde in the quotation below. Except as regards the word having been first made known to us by the Portuguese, this is an old and persistent mistake. What sort of form would mandarij be as a derivative from mandar? The Portuguese might have applied to Eastern officials some such word as mandador, which a preceding article (see MANDADORE) shows that they did apply in certain cases. But the parallel to the assumed origin of mandarin from mandar would be that English voyagers on visiting China, or some other country in the far East, should have invented, as a title for the officials of that country, a new and abnormal derivation from 'order,' and called them orderumbos.\n The word is really a slight corruption of Hind. (from Skt.) mantri, 'a counsellor, a Minister of State,' for which it was indeed the proper old preMahommedan term in India. It has been adopted, and specially affected in various Indo-Chinese countries, and particularly by the Malays, among whom it is habitually applied to the highest class of public officers (see Crawfurd's Malay Dict. s.v. [and Klinkert, who writes manteri, colloquially mentri]). Yet Crawfurd himself, strange to say, adopts the current explanation as from the Portuguese (see J. Ind. Archip. iv. 189). [Klinkert adopts the Skt. derivation.] It is, no doubt, probable that the instinctive \"striving after meaning\" may have shaped the corruption of mantri into a semblance of mandar. Marsden is still more oddly perverse, videns meliora, deteriora secutus, when he says: \"The officers next in rank to the Sultan are Mantree, which some apprehend to be a corruption of the word Mandarin, a title of distinction among the Chinese\" (H. of Sumatra, 2nd ed. 285). Ritter adopts the etymology from mandar, apparently after A. W. Schlegel.* The true etymon is pointed out in Notes and Queries in China and Japan, iii. 12, and by one of the present writers in Ocean Highways for Sept. 1872, p. 186. Several of the quotations below will show that the earlier applications of the title have no reference to China at all, but to officers of state, not only in the Malay countries, but in Continental India. We may add that mantri (see MUNTREE) is still much in vogue among the less barbarous Hill Races on the Eastern frontier of Bengal (e.g. among the Kasias (see COSSYA) as a denomination for their petty dignitaries under the chief. Gibbon was perhaps aware of the true origin of mandarin; see below.\n c.

On the origin of this weight see Sir W. Elliot's Coins of S. India. The ma\u1e47j\u0101\u1e0di seed was used as a measure of weight from very early times. A parcel of 50 taken at random gave an average weight of 4\u00b713 grs.

The royal fruit of the Mangifera indica, when of good quality is one of the richest and best fruits in the world. The original of the word is Tamil m\u0101n-k\u0101y or m\u0101n-g\u0101y, i.e. m\u0101n fruit (the tree being m\u0101marum, 'm\u0101n-tree'). The Portuguese formed from this manga, which we have adopted as mango. The tree is wild in the forests of various parts of India; but the fruit of the wild tree is uneatable.\n The word has sometimes been supposed to be Malay; but it was in fact introduced into the Archipelago, along with the fruit itself, from S. India. Rumphius (Herb. Amboyn. i. 95) traces its then recent introduction into the islands, and says that it is called (Malaic\u00e8) \"mangka, vel vulgo Manga et Mapelaam.\" This last word is only the Tamil M\u0101pa\u1e37am, i.e. 'm\u0101n fruit' again. The close approximation of the Malay mangka to the Portu guese form might suggest that the latter name was derived from Malacca. But we see manga already used by Varthema, who, according to Garcia, never really went beyond Malabar. [Mr. Skeat writes: \"The modern standard Malay word is mangga, from which the Port. form was probably taken. The other Malay form quoted from Rumphius is in standard Malay mape\u0306lam, with me\u0306pe\u0306lam, he\u0306mpe\u0306lam, ampe\u0306lam, and 'pe\u0306lam or 'plam as variants. The Javanese is pe\u0306le\u0306m.\"]\n The word has been taken to Madagascar, apparently by the Malayan colonists, whose language has left so large an impression there, in the precise shape mangka. Had the fruit been an Arab importation it is improbable that the name would have been introduced in that form.\n The N. Indian names are \u0100m and Amba, and variations of these we find in several of the older European writers. Thus Fr. Jordanus, who had been in the Konkan, and appreciated the progenitors of the Goa and Bombay Mango (c. 1328), calls the fruit Aniba. Some 30 years later John de' Marignolli calls the tree \"amburan, having a fruit of excellent fragrance and flavour, somewhat like a peach\" (Cathay, &c., ii. 362). Garcia de Orta shows how early the Bombay fruit was prized. He seems to have been the owner of the parent tree. The Skt. name is Amra, and this we find in Hwen T'sang (c. 645) phoneticised as 'An-mo-lo.\n The mango is probably the fruit alluded to by Theophrastus as having caused dysentery in the army of Alexander. (See the passage s.v. JACK).\n c. 1328. -- \"Est etiam alia arbor quae fructus facit ad modum pruni, grosissimos, qui vocantur Aniba. Hi sunt fructus ita dulces et amabiles, quod ore tenus exprimi hoc minim\u00e8 possit.\" -- Fr. Jordanus, in Rec. de Voyages, &c., iv. 42.\n c. 1334. -- \"The mango tree ('anba) resembles an orange-tree, but is larger and more leafy; no other tree gives so much shade, but this shade is unwholesome, and whoever sleeps under it gets fever.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 125. At ii. 185 he writes 'anb\u0101. [The same charge is made against the tamarind; see Burton, Ar. Nights, iii. 81.]\n c. 1349. -- \"They have also another tree called Amburan, having a fruit of excellent fragrance and flavour, somewhat like a peach.\" -- John de' Marignolli, in Ca\u1e6dhay, &c., 362.\n 1510. -- \"Another fruit is also found here, which is called Amba, the stem of which is called Manga,\" &c. -- Varthema, 160-161.\n c. 1526. -- \"Of the vegetable productions peculiar to Hindusta\u0302n one is the mango (ambeh). . . .

But come, let us taste them before His Excellency. Boy! take out six mangas.\" -- Garcia, ff. 134v, 135. This author also mentions that the mangas of Ormuz were the most cele brated; also certain mangas of Guzerat, not large, but of surpassing fragrance and flavour, and having a very small stone. Those of Balaghat were both excellent and big; the Doctor had seen two that weighed 4 arratel and a half (4\u2155 lbs.); and those of Bengal, Pegu, and Malacca were also good.\n [1569. -- \"There is much fruit that comes from Arabia and Persia, which they call mangoes (mangas), which is very good fruit.\" -- Cronica dos Reys Dormuz, translated from the Arabic in 1569.]\n c. 1590. -- \"The Mangoe (Anba). . . .

The author of Tribes on My Frontier, 1883, p. 148, mentions the luscious peirie and the delicate afoos as two fine varieties, supposed to bear the names of a certain Peres and a certain Affonso.\n 1727. -- \"The Goa mango is reckoned the largest and most delioious to the taste of any in the world, and I may add, the wholesomest and best tasted of any Fruit in the World.\" -- A.

Among many greater services to India the late Sir Proby Cautley diffused largely in Upper India the delicious fruit of the Bombay mango, previously rare there, by creating and encouraging groves of grafts on the banks of the Ganges and Jumna canals. It is especially true of this fruit (as Sultan Baber indicates) that excellence depends on the variety. The common mango is coarse and strong of turpentine. Of this only an evanescent suggestion remains to give peculiarity to the finer varieties. [A useful account of these varieties, by Mr. Maries, will be found in Watt, Econ. Dict. v. 148 seqq.]\n", "mango-bird": "s. The popular Anglo-Indian name of the beautiful golden oriole (Oriolus aureus, Jerdon). Its \"loud mellow whistle\" from the mango-groves and other gardens, which it affects, is associated in Upper India with the invasion of the hot weather.\n 1878. -- \"The mango-bird glances through the groves, and in the early morning announces his beautiful but unwelcome presence with his merle melody.\" -- Ph.

The familiar name of an excellent fish (Polynemus Visua of Buchanan, P. paradiseus of Day), in flavour somewhat resembling the smelt, but, according to Dr. Mason, nearly related to the mullets. It appears in the Calcutta market early in the hot season, and is much prized, especially when in roe. The Hindustani name is taps\u012b or tapass\u012b, 'an ascetic,' or 'penitent,' but we do not know the rationale of the name. Buchanan says that it is owing to the long fibres (or free rays), proceeding from near the head, which lead the natives to associate it with penitents who are forbidden to shave. [Dr. Grierson writes: \"What the connection of the fish with a hermit was I never could ascertain, unless it was that like wandering Fak\u012brs, they disappear directly the rains begin. Compare the uposatha of the Buddhists.\" But tapasya means 'produced by heat,' and is applied to the month Ph\u0101gun (Feb.-March) when the fish appears; and this may be the origin of the name.]\n 1781. -- \"The BOARD OF TRUSTIES Assemble on Tuesday at the New Tavern, where the Committee meet to eat Mangoe Fish for the benefit of the Subscribers and on other special affairs.\" -- Hickey's Bengal Gazette, March 3.\n [1820. -- \". . . the mangoe fish (so named from its appearing during the mangoe season). . . .

I was so curious to go upstairs, and look out of a window, to see if I could spy what the Mountebank did, and perceived that after he had cut himself under the armpits with a Razor, he rubb'd the stick with his Blood. After the two first times that he rais'd himself, the stick seemed to the very eye to grow. The third time there sprung out branches with young buds.

The narrator, then a young officer, determined with a comrade, at all hazards of fair play or foul, to solve the mystery. In the middle of the trick one suddenly seized the conjuror, whilst the other uncovered and snatched at the mango-plant. But lo! it came from the earth with a root, and the mystery was darker than ever! We tell the tale as it was told.\n It would seem that the trick was not unknown in European conjuring of the 16th or 17th centuries, e.g.\n 1657. -- \". . . trium horarum spatio arbusculam veram spitamae longitudine e mensa\u0302 facere enasci, ut et alias arbores frondiferas et fructiferas.\" -- MagiaUniversalis, of P.

The Siamese form maangkhut given in M'Farland's Siamese Grammar is probably from the Malay manggusta. It was very interesting to me to find that some distinct trace of this word was still preserved in the name of this fruit at PataniKelantan on the E. coast, where it was called bawah 'seta (or 'setar), i.e. the 'setar fruit,' as well as occasionally mestar or mesetar, clearly a corruption of some such old form as manggistar.\"] This delicious fruit is known throughout the Archipelago, and in Siam, by modifications of the same name; the delicious fruit of the GarciniaMangostana (Nat.

The sea-loving genera Rhizophora and Avicennia derive this name, which applies to both, from some happy accident, but from which of two sources may be doubtful. For while the former genus is, according to Crawfurd, called by the Malays manggi-manggi, a term which he supposes to be the origin of the English name, we see from Oviedo that one or other was called mangle in S. America, and in this, which is certainly the origin of the French manglier, we should be disposed also to seek the derivation of the English word. Both genera are universal in the tropical tidal estuaries of both Old World and New. Prof. Sayce, by an amusing slip, or oversight probably of somebody else's slip, quotes from Humboldt that \"maize, mangle, hammock, canoe, tobacco, are all derived through the medium of the Spanish from the Haytian mahiz, mangle, hamaca, canoa, and tabaco.\" It is, of course, the French and not the English mangle that is here in question. [Mr. Skeat observes: \"I believe the old English as well as French form was mangle, in which case Prof. Sayce would be perfectly right. Mangrove is probably manglegrove.  The Malay manggi-manggi is given by Klinkert, and is certainly on account of the reduplication, native. But I never heard it in the Peninsula, where mangrove is always called bakau.\"] The mangrove abounds on nearly all the coasts of further India, and also on the sea margin of the Ganges Delta, in the backwaters of S. Malabar, and less luxuriantly on the Indus mouths.\n 1535. -- \"Of the Tree called Mangle. . . . These trees grow in places of mire, and on the shores of the sea, and of the rivers, and streams, and torrents that run into the sea.

But Manilla-man seems also, from Wilson, to be used in S. India as a hybrid from Telug. manel\u0101 v\u0101du, 'an itinerant dealer in coral and gems'; perhaps in this sense, as he says, from Skt. ma\u1e47i, 'a jewel,' but with some blending also of the Port. manilha, 'a bracelet.'

But in Madras Presidency the word had formerly a very specialised sense as the recognised title of that branch of the Executive which included the conservation of irrigation tanks and the like, and which was worked under the District Civil Officers, there being then no separate department of the State in charge of Civil Public Works. It is a curious illustration of the wide spread at one time of Musulman power that the same Arabic word, in the form Marama, is still applied in Sicily to a standing committee charged with repairs to the Duomo or Cathedral of Palermo. An analogous instance of the wide grasp of the Saracenic power is mentioned by one of the Musulman authors whom Amari quotes in his History of the Mahommedan rule in Sicily. It is that the Caliph Al-M\u0101m\u016bn, under whom conquest was advancing in India and in Sicily simultaneously, ordered that the idols taken from the infidels in India should be sent for sale to the infidels in Sicily!\n [1757. -- \"On the 6th the Major (Eyre Coote) left Muxadabad with . . . 10 Marmutty men, or pioneers to clear the road.\" -- Ives, 156.\n [1873. -- \"For the actual execution of works there was a Maramat Department constituted under the Collector.\" -- Boswell, Man. of Nellore, 642.]\n", "margosa": "s.

They were sometimes called Pegu jars, and under that name specimens were shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851. We have not been able to obtain recent information on the subject of this manufacture. The word appears to be now obsolete in India, except as a colloquial term in Telegu. [The word is certainly not obsolete in Upper India: \"The martaban' (Plate ii. fig. 10) is a small deep jar with an elongated body, which is used by Hindus and Muhammadans to keep pickles and acid articles\" (Hallifax, Mono. of Punjab Pottery, p. 9). In the endeavour to supply a Hindi derivation it has been derived from imrita-b\u0101n, 'the holder of the water of immortality.'

This is no specially Anglo-Indian word; our excuse for introducing it is the belief that it is of Arabic origin. Popular assumption, we believe, derives the name from a mythical Colonel Martingale. But the word seems to come to us from the French, in which language, besides the English use, Littr\u00e9 gives chauses \u00e0 la martingale as meaning \"culottes dont le pont \u00e9tait plac\u00e9 par derriere,\" and this he strangely declares to be the true and original meaning of the word. His etymology, after M\u00e9nage, is from Martigues in Provence, where, it is alleged, breeches of this kind were worn. Skeat seems to accept these explanations. [But see his Concise Dict., where he inclines to the view given in this article, and adds: \"I find Arab. rataka given by Richardson as a verbal root, whence ratak, going with a short quick step.\"] But there is a Span. word al-martaga, for a kind of bridle, which Urrea quoted by Dozy derives from verb Arab. rataka, \"qui, \u00e0 la IVe forme signifie 'effecit ut brevibus assibus incederet.'\" This is precisely the effect of a martingale. And we venture to say that probably the word bore its English meaning originally also in French and Spanish, and came from Arabic direct into the latter tongue. Dozy himself, we should add, is inclined to derive the Span. word from al-mirta'a, 'a halter.'\n", "marw\u00e1ree": "n.p. and s.

Logan (Malabar, i. 332 note) says that Marakkar means 'doer or follower of the Law' (marggam), and is applied to a foreign religion, like that of Christians and Mohammedans. The Madras Gloss.

An assistant under a head servant; in which sense or something near it, but also sometimes in the sense of a 'head-man,' the word is in use almost all over India. In the Bengal Presidency we have a mate-bearer for the assistant bodyservant (see BEARER); the mate attendant on an elephant under the mahout; a mate (head) of coolies or jomponnies (qq.v.) (see JOMPON), &c. And in Madras the maty is an under-servant, whose business it is to clean crockery, knives, &c., to attend to lamps, and so forth.\n The origin of the word is obscure, if indeed it has not more than one origin. Some have supposed it to be taken from the English word in the sense of comrade, &c.; whilst Wilson gives me\u1e6d\u1e6di as a distinct Malay\u0101lam word for an inferior domestic servant, [which the Madras Gloss. derives from Tamil mel, 'high']. The last word is of very doubtful genuineness. Neither derivation will explain the fact that the word occurs in the \u0100\u012bn, in which the three classes of attendants on an elephant in Akbar's establishment are styled respectively Mah\u0101wa, Bho\u012b, and Meth; two of which terms would, under other circumstances, probably be regarded as corruptions of English words. This use of the word we find in Skt. dictionaries as me\u1e6dha, me\u1e6dha, me\u1e47\u1e6dha, and me\u1e47\u1e0da, 'an elephant-keeper or feeder.' But for the more general use we would query whether it may not be a genuine Prakrit form from Skt. mitra, 'associate, friend'? We have in Pali metta, 'friendship,' from Skt. maitra.\n c. 1590. -- \"A met'h fetches fodder and assists in caparisoning the elephant.

The word is quite obsolete, and is introduced here because it seems to have survived a good deal longer in India than in England, and occurs frequently in old Indian narratives. It is Germ. matrose, Dutch matroos, 'a sailor,' identical no doubt with Fr. matelot. The origin is so obscure that it seems hardly worth while to quote the conjectures regarding it. In the establishment of a company of Royal Artillery in 1771, as given in Duncan's Hist. of that corps, we have besides sergeants and corporals, \"4 Bombardiers, 8 Gunners, 34 Matrosses, and 2 Drummers.\" A definition of the Matross is given in our 3rd quotation. We have not ascertained when the term was disused in the R.A. It appears in the Establishment as given by Grose in 1801 (Military Antiq. i. 315). As far as Major Duncan's book informs us, it appears first in 1639, and has disappeared by 1793, when we find the men of an artillery force divided (excluding sergeants, corporals, and bombardiers) into First Gunners, Second Gunners, and Military Drivers.\n 1673. -- \"There being in pay for the Honourable East India Company of English and Portuguese, 700, reckoning the Montrosses and Gunners.\" -- Fryer, 38.\n 1745. -- \". . .

Domestic Hind. m\u0101mlat, for 'omelet'; [M\u0101ml\u0113t is 'marmalade'].\n", "maund": "s. The authorised Anglo-Indian form of the name of a weight (Hind. man, Mahr. ma\u1e47), which, with varying values, has been current over Western Asia from time immemorial. Professor Sayce traces it (mana) back to the Accadian language.* But in any case it was the Babylonian name for 1\u204480 of a talent, whence it passed, with the Babylonian weights and measures, almost all over the ancient world. Compare the men or mna of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions, preserved in the emna or amna of the Copts, the Hebrew m\u0101neh, the Greek MNA=, and the Roman mina. The introduction of the word into India may have occurred during the extensive commerce of the Arabs with that country during the 8th and 9th centuries; possibly at an earlier date. Through the Arabs also we find an old Spanish word almena, and in old French alm\u00e8ne, for a weight of about 20 lbs. (Marcel Devic).\n The quotations will show how the Portuguese converted man into ma\u0303o, of which the English made maune, and so (probably by the influence of the See Sayce, Principles of Comparative Philology, 2nd ed. 208-211.\n old English word maund)* our present form, which occurs as early as 1611. Some of the older travellers, like Linschoten, misled by the Portuguese ma\u0303o, identified it with the word for 'hand' in that language, and so rendered it.\n The values of the man as weight, even in modern times, have varied immensely, i.e. from little more than 2 lbs. to upwards of 160. The 'Indian Maund,' which is the standard of weight in British India, is of 40 sers, each ser being divided into 16 chhi\u1e6d\u0101ks; and this is the general scale of subdivision in the local weights of Bengal, and Upper and Central India, though the value of the ser varies. That of the standard ser is 80 tolas (q.v.) or rupee-weights, and thus the maund= 82 2\u20447 lbs. avoirdupois. The Bombay maund (or man) of 48 sers=28 lbs.; the Madras one of 40 sers=25 lbs. The Palloda man of Ahmadnagar contained 64 sers, and was=163\u00bc lbs. This is the largest man we find in the 'Useful Tables.' The smallest Indian man again is that of Colachy in Travancore, and that=18 lbs. 12 oz. 13 dr. The Persian Tabr\u012bz\u012b man is, however, a little less than 7 lbs.; the man sh\u0101h\u012b twice that; the smallest of all on the list named is the Jeddah man=2 lbs. 3 oz. 9\u00be dr.\n B.C. 692. -- In the \"Eponymy of Zazai,\" a house in Nineveh, with its shrubbery and gates, is sold for one maneh of silver according to the royal standard.

As noticed under the preceding article, MOGOL, MOGOR, and also Mogolistan are applied among old writers to the dominions of the Great Mogul. We have found no native idiom precisely suggesting the latter title; but Mughal is thus used in the Araish-i-Mahfil below, and Mogolistan must have been in some native use, for it is a form that Europeans would not have invented.

The official name of the chief gold coin of British India, Hind. from Pers. muhr, a (metallic) seal, and thence a gold coin. It seems possible that the word is taken from mihr, 'the sun,' as one of the secondary meanings of that word is 'a golden circlet on the top of an umbrella, or the like' (Vullers). [Platts, on the contrary, identifies it with Skt. mudr\u0101, 'a seal.']\n The term muhr, as applied to a coin, appears to have been popular only and quasi-generic, not precise. But that to which it has been most usually applied, at least in recent centuries, is a coin which has always been in use since the foundation of the Mahommedan Empire in Hindustan by the Gh\u016br\u012b Kings of Ghazni and their freedmen, circa A.D. 1200, tending to a standard weight of 100 ratis (see RUTTEE) of pure gold, or about 175 grains, thus equalling in weight, and probably intended then to equal ten times in value, the silver coin which has for more than three centuries been called Rupee.\n ing this as the theory of the system.* But the gold coins, especially, have deviated from the theory considerably; a deviation which seems to have commenced with the violent innovations of Sultan Mahommed Tughlak (1325 1351), who raised the gold coin to 200 grains, and diminished the silver coin to 140 grains, a change which may have been connected with the enormous influx of gold into Upper India, from the plunder of the immemorial accumulations of the Peninsula in the first quarter of the 14th century. After this the coin again settled down in approximation to the old weight, insomuch that, on taking the weight of 46 different mohurs from the lists given in Prinsep's Tables, the average of pure gold is 167\u00b722 grains.\u2020\n The first gold mohur struck by the Company's Government was issued in 1766, and declared to be a legal tender for 14 sicca rupees. The full weight of this coin was 179\u00b766 grs., containing 149\u00b772 grs. of gold. But it was impossible to render it current at the rate fixed; it was called in, and in 1769 a new mohur was issued to pass as legal tender for 16 sicca rupees. The weight of this was 190\u00b7773 grs. (according to Regn. of 1793, 190\u00b7894), and it contained 190\u00b7086 grs. of gold. Regulation xxxv. of 1793 declared these gold mohurs to be a legal tender in all public and private transactions. Regn. xiv. of 1818 declared, among other things, that \"it has been thought advisable to make a slight deduction in the intrinsic value of the gold mohur to be coined at this Presidency (Fort William), in order to raise the value of fine gold to fine silver, from the present rates of 1 to 14\u00b7861 to that of 1 to 15. The gold mohur will still continue to pass current at the rate of 16 rupees.\" The new gold mohur was to weigh 204\u00b7710 grs., containing fine gold 187\u00b7651 grs. Once more Act xvii. of 1835 declared that the only gold coin to be coined at Indian mints should be (with propor See Cathay, &c., pp. ccxlvii.-ccl.; and Mr. E. Thomas, Path\u00e1n Kings of Delhi, passim.\n The average was taken as follows: -- (1). We took the whole of the weight of gold in the list at p. 43 (\"Table of the Gold Coins of India\") with the omission of four pieces which are exceptionally debased; and (2), the first twenty-four pieces in the list at p. 50 (\"Supplementary Table\"), omitting two exceptional cases, and divided by the whole number of coins so taken. See the tables at end of Thomas's ed. of Prinsep's Essays.\n tionate subdivisions) a gold mohur or \"15 rupee piece\" of the weight of 180 grs. troy, containing 165 grs. of pure gold; and declared also that no gold coin should thenceforward be a legal tender of payment in any of the territories of the E.I.

The 'Spice Islands,' strictly speaking the five Clove Islands, lying to the west of Gilolo, and by name Ternate (Tarn\u0101ti), Tidore (Tidori), Mortir, Makian, and Bachian. [See Mr. Gray's note on Pyrard de Laval, Hak. Soc. ii. 166.] But the application of the name has been extended to all the islands under Dutch rule, between Celebes and N. Guinea. There is a Dutch governor residing at Amboyna, and the islands are divided into 4 residencies, viz. Amboyna, Banda, Ternate and Manado. The origin of the name Molucca, or Maluco as the Portuguese called it, is not recorded; but it must have been that by which the islands were known to the native traders at the time of the Portuguese discoveries. The early accounts often dwell on the fact that each island (at least three of them) had a king of its own. Possibly they got the (Ar.) name of Jaz\u012brat-al-Mul\u016bk, 'The Isles of the Kings.'\n Valentijn probably entertained the same view of the derivation. He begins his account of the islands by saying:\n \"There are many who have written of the Moluccos and of their Kings, but we have hitherto met with no writer who has given an exact view of the subject\" (Deel, i. Mol. 3).\n And on the next page he says:\n \"For what reason they have been called Moluccos we shall not here say; for we shall do this circumstantially when we shall speak of the Molukse Kings and their customs.\"\n But we have been unable to find the fulfilment of this intention, though probably it exists in that continent of a work somewhere. We have also seen a paper by a writer who draws much from the quarry of Valentijn. This is an article by Dr. Van Muschenbroek in the Proceedings of the International Congress of Geog. at Venice in 1881 (ii. pp. 596, seqq.), in which he traces the name to the same origin. He appears to imply that the chiefs were known among themselves as Molokos, and that this term was substituted for the indigenous Kolano, or King. \"Ce nom, ce titre rest\u00e8rent, et furent m\u00eame peu \u00e0 peu employ\u00e9s, non seulement pour les chefs, mais aussi pour l'\u00e9tat m\u00eame. A la longue les \u00eeles et les \u00e9tats des Molokos devinrent les \u00eeles et les \u00e9tats Molokos.\" There is a good deal that is questionable, however, in this writer's deductions and etymologies.

A sailor once picked up a large seedy fruit in the Indian Ocean off Bombay, and brought it to me. It was very rotten, but I planted the seeds. It turned out to be Kigelia pinnata of E. Africa, and propagated so rapidly that in a few years I introduced it all over the Bombay Presidency. The Baobab however is generally found most abundant about the old ports frequented by the early Mahommedan traders\" (Sir G. Birdwood, MS.) We may add that it occurs sparsely about Allahabad, where it was introduced apparently in the Mogul time; and in the Gangetic valley as far E. as Calcutta, but always planted. There are, or were, noble specimens in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta, and in Mr. Arthur Grote's garden at Alip\u016br. [See Watt, Econ. Dict. i. 105.]\n", "monsoon": "s. The name given to the periodical winds of the Indian seas, and of the seasons which they affect and characterize. The original word is the Ar. mausim, 'season,' which the Portuguese corrupted into mon\u00e7a\u0303o, and our people into monsoon. Dictionaries (except Dr. Badger's) do not apparently give the Arabic word mausim the technical sense of monsoon. But there can be no doubt that it had that sense among the Arab pilots from whom the Portuguese adopted the word. This is shown by the quotations from the Turkish Admiral Sidi 'Ali. \"The rationale of the term is well put in the Beir\u016bt Mo\u1e25\u012bt, which says: 'Mausim is used of anything that comes round but once a year, like the festivals. In Lebanon the mausim is the season of working with the silk,' -- which is the important season there, as the season of navigation is in Yemen.\" (W. R. S.)\n The Spaniards in America would seem to have a word for season in analogous use for a recurring wind, as may be gathered from Tom Cringle.* The Venetian, Leonardo Ca' Masser (below) calls the monsoons li tempi. And the quotation from Garcia De Orta shows that in his time the Portuguese sometimes used the word for season without any apparent reference to the wind. Though mon\u00e7a\u0303o is general with the Portuguese writers of the 16th century, the historian Diogo de Couto always writes mou\u00e7a\u0303o, and it is possible that the n came in, as in some other cases, by a habitual misreading of the written u for n. Linschoten in Dutch (1596) has monssoyn and monssoen (p. 8; [Hak. Soc. i. 33]). It thus appears probable that we get our monsoon from the Dutch. The latter in modern times seem to have commonly adopted the French form mousson. [Prof. Skeat traces our monsoon from Ital. monsone.] We see below (Ces. Feder.) that Monsoon was used as synonymous with \"the half year,\" and so it is still in S. India.\n 1505. -- \"De qui passano el colfo de Colocut che sono leghe 800 de pacizo (? passeggio): aspettano li tempi che sono nel principio dell' Autuno, e con le cole fatte(?) passano.\" -- Leonardo di Ca' Masser, 26.\n [1512. -- \". . . because the mau\u00e7am for both the voyages is at one and the same time.\" -- Albuquerque, Cartas, p. 30.]\n 1553. -- \". . . and the more, because the voyage from that region of Malaca had to be made by the prevailing wind, which they call mon\u00e7a\u0303o, which was now near its end.

In India it is used in these senses, and for a man who reads the \u1e32or\u0101n in a house for 40 days after a death. When oaths were administered on the \u1e32or\u0101n, the servitor who held the book was called Mull\u0101 \u1e32or\u0101n\u012b. Mull\u0101 is also in India the usual Mussulman term for 'a schoolmaster.'\n 1616. -- \"Their Moolaas employ much of their time like Scriueners to doe businesse for others.\" -- Terry, in Purchas, ii. 1476.\n [1617. -- \"He had shewed it to his Mulaies.\" -- Sir T.

Some remarks will be found in Collingwood's Rambles of a Naturalist, pp. 308-10. The present writer has in the East twice suffered from a peculiar affection of the eyes and face, after being in sleep exposed to a bright moon, but he would hardly have used the term moonblindness. \n", "moong": "s.

It is commonly applied by Europeans specifically to a native teacher of languages, especially of Arabic, Persian, and Urd\u016b, though the application to a native amanuensis in those tongues, and to any respectable, well-educated native gentleman is also common. The word probably became tolerably familiar in Europe through a book of instruction in Persian bearing the name (viz. \"The Persian Moonshee, by F.

Provinces, 155.]\n", "moor": "s. (and adj. MOORISH ). A Mahommedan; and so from the habitual use of the term (Mouro), by the Portuguese in India, particularly a Mahommedan inhabitant of India.\n In the Middle Ages, to Europe generally, the Mahommedans were known as the Saracens. This is the word always used by Joinville, and by Marco Polo. Ibn Batuta also mentions the fact in a curious passage (ii. 425-6). At a later day, when the fear of the Ottoman had made itself felt in Europe, the word Turk was that which identified itself with the Moslem, and thus we have in the Collect for Good Friday, -- \"Jews, Turks, lnfidels, and Heretics.\" But to the Spaniards and Portuguese, whose contact was with the Musulmans of Mauritania who had passed over and conquered the Peninsula, all Mahommedans were Moors. So the Mahommedans whom the Portuguese met with on their voyages to India, on what coast soever, were alike styled Mouros; and from the Portuguese the use of this term, as synonymous with Mahommedan, passed to Hollanders and Englishmen.\n The word then, as used by the Portuguese discoverers, referred to religion, and implied no nationality. It is plain indeed from many passages that the Moors of Calicut and Cochin were in the beginning of the 16th century people of mixt race, just as the Moplahs (q.v.) are now. The Arab, or Arabo-African occupants of Mozambique and Melinda, the Sum\u0101lis of Magadoxo, the Arabs and Persians of Kalh\u0101t and Ormuz, the Boras of Guzerat, are all Mouros to the Portuguese writers, though the more intelligent among these are quite conscious of the impropriety of the term. The Moors of the Malabar coast were middlemen, who had adopted a profession of Islam for their own convenience, and in order to minister for their own profit to the constant traffic of merchants from Ormuz and the Arabian ports. Similar influences still affect the boatmen of the same coast, among whom it has become a sort of custom in certain families, that different members should profess respectively Mahommedanism, Hinduism, and Christianity.\n The use of the word Moor for Mahommedan died out pretty well among educated Europeans in the Bengal Presidency in the beginning of the last century, or even earlier, but probably held its ground a good deal longer among the British soldiery, whilst the adjective Moorish will be found in our quotations nearly as late as 1840. In Ceylon, the Straits, and the Dutch Colonies, the term Moorman for a Musalman is still in common use. Indeed the word is still employed by the servants of Madras officers in speaking of Mahommedans, or of a certain cl\u00e0ss of these. Moro is still applied at Manilla to the Musulman Malays.\n 1498. -- \". . . the Moors never came to the house when this trading went on, and we became aware that they wished us ill, insomuch that when any of us went ashore, in order to annoy us they would spit on the ground, and say 'Portugal, Portugal.'\"- Roteiro de V. da Gama, p. 75.\n \" \"For you must know, gentlemen, that from the moment you put into port here (Calecut) you caused disturbance of mind to the Moors of this city, who are numerous and very powerful in the country.\" -- Correa, Hak.

The idiom is a curious old English one for the denomination of a language, of which 'broad Scots' is perhaps a type, and which we find exemplified in 'Malabars' (see MALABAR) for Tamil, whilst we have also met with Bengals for Beng\u0101l\u012b, with Indostans for Urd\u016b, and with Turks for Turkish. The term Moors is probably now entirely obsolete, but down to 1830, at least, some old officers of the Royal army and some old Madras civilians would occasionally use the term as synonymous with what the former would also call 'the black language.'

He writes chookerau, chookeree, for chhokr\u0101, chhokr\u012b ('boy, girl'); dolchinney for d\u0101l-ch\u012bn\u012b ('cinnamon'), &c. His etymological ideas also are loose. Thus he gives 'shrimps=ch\u00eenghra mutchee, 'fish with legs and claws,' as if the word was from chang (Pers.), 'a hook or claw.' B\u0101g\u1e0dor, 'a halter,' or as he writes, baug-doore, he derives from d\u016br, 'distance,' instead of \u1e0dor, 'a rope.' He has no knowledge of the instrumental case with terminal ne, and he does not seem to be aware that ham and tum (hum and toom, as he writes) are in reality plurals ('we' and 'you'). The grammar is altogether of a very primitive and tentative character, and far behind that of the R. C. Missionaries, which is referred to s.v. Hindostanee.

The Portuguese word again represents the Konkani and Mahratti mo\u1e0dach\u012b, mo\u1e0dsh\u012b, or mo\u1e0dwash\u012b, 'cholera,' from a Mahr. verb mo\u1e0dnen, 'to break up, to sink' (as under infirmities, in fact 'to collapse').

And this malady attacked people without any cause that could be assigned, falling upon sick and sound alike, on the fat and the lean; and nothing in the world was a safeguard against it. And this malady attacked the stomach, caused as some experts affirmed by chill; though later it was maintained that no cause whatever could be discovered. The malady was so powerful and so evil that it immediately produced the symptoms of strong poison; e.g., vomiting, constant desire for water, with drying of the stomach; and cramps that contracted the hams and the soles of the feet, with such pains that the patient seemed dead, with the eyes broken and the nails of the fingers and toes black and crumpled. And for this malady our physicians never found any cure; and the patient was carried off in one day, or at the most in a day and night; insomuch that not ten in a hundred recovered, and those who did recover were such as were healed in haste with medicines of little importance known to the natives. So great was the mortality this season that the bells were tolling all day . . . insomuch that the governor forbade the tolling of the church bells, not to frighten the people . . . and when a man died in the hospital of this malady of morexy the Governor ordered all the experts to come together and open the body.

The most common modern Hind. term for cholera is Arab. hai\u1e93ah. The latter word is given by Garcia de Orta in the form hachaiza, and in the quotation from Couto as sachaiza (?). Jah\u0101ng\u012br speaks of one of his nobles as dying in the Deccan, of hai\u1e93ah, in A.D. 1615 (see note to Elliot, vi. 346). It is, however, perhaps not to be assumed that hai\u1e93ah always means cholera. Thus Macpherson mentions that a violent epidemic, which raged in the Camp of Aurangz\u012bb at B\u012bjapur in 1689, is called so. But in the history of Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (Elliot, vii. 337) the general phrases ta'\u016bn and wab\u0101 are used in reference to this disease, whilst the description is that of bubonic plague.\n 1781. -- \"Early in the morning of the 21st June (1781) we had two men seized with the mort-de-chien.\" -- Curtis, Diseases of India, 3rd ed., Edinb., 1807.\n 1782. -- \"Les indigestions appell\u00e9es dans l'Inde Mort-de-chien, sont fr\u00e9quentes.

This author writes just after having described two epidemics of cholera under the name of Flux aigu. He did not apprehend that this was in fact the real Mortde-chien.\n 1783. -- \"A disease generally called 'Mortde-chien' at this time (during the defence of Onore) raged with great violence among the native inhabitants.\" -- Forbes, Or. Mem. iv. 122.\n 1796. -- \"Far more dreadful are the consequences of the above-mentioned intestinal colic, called by the Indians shani, mordexim and also Nircomben. It is occasioned, as I have said, by the winds blowing from the mountains . . . the consequence is that malignant and bilious slimy matter adheres to the bowels, and occasions violent pains, vomiting, fevers, and stupefaction; so that persons attacked with the disease die very often in a few hours. It sometimes happens that 30 or 40 persons die in this manner, in one place, in the course of the day. . . . In the year 1782 this disease raged with so much fury that a great many persons died of it.\" -- Fra Paolino, E.T. 409-410 (orig. see p. 353). As to the names used by Fra Paolino, for his Shani or Ciani, we find nothing nearer than Tamil and Mal. sanni, 'convulsion, paralysis.' (Winslow in his Tamil Dict. specifies 13 kinds of sanni. Komben is explained as 'a kind of cholera or smallpox' (!); and nir-komben ('water-k.') as a kind of cholera or bilious diarrh\u0153a.) Paolino adds: \"La droga amara costa assai, e non si poteva amministrare a tanti miserabili che perivano. Adunque in mancanza di questa droga amara noi distillasimo in T\u00e0gara, o acqua vite di coco, molto sterco di cavalli (!), c l'amministrammo agl' infermi.

Drummond, Illustrations, &c. A curious notice; and the author was, we presume, from his title of \"Dr.,\" a medical man. We suppose for England above should be read India.\n The next quotation is the latest instance of the familiar use of the word that we have met with:\n 1812. -- \"General M --- was taken very ill three or four days ago; a kind of fit mort de chien -- the doctor said, brought on by eating too many radishes.\" -- Original Familiar Correspondence between Residents in India, &c., Edinburgh, 1846, p. 287.\n 1813. -- \"Mort de chien is nothing more than the highest degree of Cholera Morbus.\" -- Johnson, Infl. of Tropical Climate, 405.\n The second of the following quotations evidently refers to the outbreak of cholera mentioned, after Macpherson, in the next paragraph.\n 1780. -- \"I am once or twice a year (!) subject to violent attacks of cholera morbus, here called mort-de-chien. . . .\" -- Impey to Dunning, quoted by Sir James Stephen, ii. 339.\n 1781. -- \"The Plague is now broke out in Bengal, and rages with great violence; it has swept away already above 4000 persons. 200 or upwards have been buried in the different Portuguese churches within a few days.\" -- Hicky's Bengal Gazette, April 21.\n These quotations show that cholera, whether as an epidemic or as sporadic disease, is no new thing in India. Almost in the beginning of the Portuguese expeditions to the East we find apparent examples of the visitations of this terrible scourge, though no precise name is given in the narratives. Thus we read in the Life of Giovanni da Emboli, an adventurous young Florentine who served with the Portuguese, that, arriving in China in 1517, the ships' crews were attacked by a pessima malatia di frusso (virulent flux) of such kind that there died thereof about 70 men, and among these Giovanni himself, and two other Florentines (Vita, in Archiv. Stor. Ital. 33). Correa says that, in 1503, 20,000 men died of a like disease in the army of the Zamorin. We have given above Correa's description of the terrible Goa pest of 1543, which was most evidently cholera. Madras accounts, according to Macpherson, first mention the disease at Arcot in 1756, and there are frequent notices of it in that neighbourhood between 1763 and 1787. The Hon. R. Lindsay speaks of it as raging at Sylhet in 1781, after carrying off a number of the inhabitants of Calcutta (Macpherson, see the quotation of 1781 above). It also raged that year at Ganjam, and out of a division of 5000 Bengal troops under Col. Pearse, who were on the march through that district, 1143 were in a few days sent into hospital, whilst \"death raged in the camp with a horror not to be described. \" The earliest account from the pen of an English physician is by Dr. Paisley, and is dated Madras, Feby. 1774. In 1783 it broke out at Hardw\u0101r Fair, and is said, in less than 8 days, to have carried off 20,000 pilgrims. The paucity of cases of cholera among European troops in the returns up to 1817, is ascribed by Dr. Macnamara to the way in which facts were disguised by the current nomenclature of disease. It need not perhaps be denied that the outbreak of 1817 marked a great recrudescence of the disease. But it is a fact that some of the more terrible features of the epidemic, which are then spoken of as quite new, had been prominently described at Goa nearly three centuries before.\n See on this subject an article by Dr. J. Macpherson in Quarterly Review, for Jany. 1867, and a Treatise on Asiatic Cholera, by C. Macnamara, 1876. To these, and especially to the former, we owe several facts and references; though we had recorded quotations relating to mordexin and its identity with cholera some years before even the earlier of these publications.\n", "mordexim": "s. Also the name of a sea-fish. Bluteau says 'a fish found at the Isle of Quixembe on the Coast of Mozambique, very like bogas (?) or river-pikes.'\n", "mosellay": "n.p.

There is no room for doubt as to the original of this word being the Ar. masjid, 'a place of worship,' literally the place of suj\u016bd, i.e. 'prostration.' And the probable course is this. Masjid becomes (1) in Span. mezquita, Port. mesquita;* (2) According to Pyrard mesquite is the word used in the Maldive Islands. It is difficult to suppose the people would adopt such a word from the Portuguese. And probably the form both in east and west is to be accounted for by a hard pronunciation of the Arabic j, as in Egypt now; the older and probably the most widely diffused. [See Mr. Gray's note in Hak. Soc. ii. 417.]\n Ital. meschita, moschea; French (old) mosquete, mosqu\u00e9e; (3) Eng. mosque.

Baker, \"not more than one in 300 has tusks; they are merely provided with short grubbers, projecting generally about 3 inches from the upper jaw, and about 2 inches in diameter.\" (The Rifle and Hound in Ceylon, 11.) Sanderson (13 Years among the Wild Beasts of India, [3rd ed. 66]) says: \"On the Continent of India mucknas, or elephants born without tusks, are decidedly rare . . . Mucknas breed in the herds, and the peculiarity is not hereditary or transmitted.\" This author also states that out of 51 male elephants captured by him in Mysore and Bengal only 5 were mucknas. But the definition of a makhn\u0101 in Bengal is that which we have given, including those animals which possess only feminine or rudimentary tusks, the 'short grubbers' of Baker; and these latter can hardly be called rare among domesticated elephants. This may be partially due to a preference in purchasers.* The same author derives the term from mukh, 'face'; but the reason is obscure. Shakespear and Platts give the word as also applied to 'a cock without spurs.'\n c. 1780. -- \"An elephant born with the left tooth only is reckoned sacred; with black spots in the mouth unlucky, and not saleable; the mukna or elephant born without teeth is thought the best.\" -- Hon.

In the 18th century, and including Regulation IX. of 1793, which gave the Company's Courts in Bengal the reorganization which substantially endured till 1862, we have frequent mention of both Cauzies and Mufties as authorized expounders of the Mahommedan Law; but, though K\u0101\u1e93\u012bs were nominally maintained in the Provincial Courts down to their abolition (1829-31), practically the duty of those known as K\u0101z\u012bs became limited to quite different objects and the designation of the Law-officer who gave the futw\u0101 in our District Courts was Maulav\u012b.

It is impossible to deviate without deterioration from Wilson's definition of this obscure name: \"A name commonly applied to the natives of Arakan, particularly those bordering on Bengal, or residing near the sea; the people of Chittagong.\" It is beside the question of its origin or proper application, to say, as Wilson goes on to say, on the authority of Lieut. (now Sir Arthur) Phayre, that the Arakanese disclaim the title, and restrict it to a class held in contempt, viz. the descendants of Arakanese settlers on the frontier of Bengal by Bengali mothers. The proper names of foreign nations in any language do not require the sanction of the nation to whom they are applied, and are often not recognised by the latter. German is not the German name for the Germans, nor Welsh the Welsh name for the Welsh, nor Hindu (originally) a Hindu word, nor China a Chinese word. The origin of the present word is very obscure. Sir A. Phayre kindly furnishes us with this note: \"There is good reason to conclude that the name is derived from Maga, the name of the ruling race for many centuries in Magadha (modern Behar). The kings of Arakan were no doubt originally of this race. For though this is not distinctly expressed in the histories of Arakan, there are several legends of Kings from Benares reigning in that country, and one regarding a Brahman who marries a native princess, and whose descendants reign for a long period. I say this, although Buchanan appears to reject the theory (see Montg. Martin, ii. 18 seqq.)\" The passage is quoted below.\n On the other hand the Mahommedan writers sometimes confound Buddhists with fire-worshippers, and it seems possible that the word may have been Pers. magh='magus.'

Properly Manip\u016br; a quasi-independent State lying between the British district of Cachar on the extreme east of Bengal, and the upper part of the late kingdom of Burma, and in fact including a part of the watershed between the tributaries of the Brahmaputra and those of the Irawadi. The people are of genuinely Indo-Chinese and Mongoloid aspect, and the State, small and secluded as it is, has had its turn in temporary conquest and domination, like almost all the States of Indo-China from the borders of Assam to the mouth of the Mekong. Like the other Indo-Chinese States, too, Manip\u016br has its royal chronicle, but little seems to have been gathered from it. The R\u0101jas and people have, for a period which seems uncertain, professed Hindu religion. A disastrous invasion of Manip\u016br by Alompra, founder of the present Burmese dynasty, in 1755, led a few years afterwards to negotiations with the Bengal Government, and the conclusion of a treaty, in consequence of which a body of British sepoys was actually despatched in 1763, but eventually returned without reaching Manip\u016br. After this, intercourse practically ceased till the period of our first Burmese War (1824-25), when the country was overrun by the Burmese, who also entered Cachar; and British troops, joined with a Manip\u016br\u012b force, expelled them. Since then a British officer has always been resident at Manip\u016br, and at one time (c. 1838-41) a great deal of labour was expended on opening a road between Cachar and Manip\u016br. [The murder of Mr. Quinton, Chief-Commissioner of Assam, and other British officers at Manip\u016br, in the close of 1890, led to the inflic tion of severe punishment on the leaders of the outbreak. The Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, whose abdication led to this tragedy, died in Calcutta in the following year, and the State is now under British management during the minority of his successor.]\n This State has been called by a variety of names. Thus, in Rennell's Memoir and maps of India it bears the name of Meckley. In Symes's Narrative, and in maps of that period, it is Cassay; names, both of which have long disappeared from modern maps. Meckley represents the name (Makli?) by which the country was known in Assam; Mogli. (apparently a form of the same) was the name in Cachar; Ka-s\u00e9 or Ka-th\u00e9 (according to the Ava pronunciation) is the name by which it is known to the Shans or Burmese.\n 1755. -- \"I have carried my Arms to the confines of CHINA . . . on the other quarter I have reduced to my subjection the major part of the Kingdom of Cassay; whose Heir I have taken captive, see there he sits behind you. . . .\" -- Speech of Alompra to Capt.

In many cases the title was but nominal, and often it was assumed without warrant. [Mr. Irvine discusses the question at length and represents man\u1e63ab by \"the word 'rank,' as its object was to settle precedence and fix gradation of pay; it did not necessarily imply the exercise of any particular office, and meant nothing beyond the fact that the holder was in the employ of the State, and bound in return to yield certain services when called upon.\" (J.R.A.S., July 1896, pp. 510 seqq.)]\n [1617. -- \". . . slew one of them and twelve Maancipdares.\" -- Sir T.

This is testified by Captain Munro in the passage quoted below; but it was also shown during Lord Canning's visit to Lahore in 1860, in a manner which dwells in the memory of one of the present writers. The escort consisted of part of a Highland regiment. A venerable Sikh chief who heard the pipes exclaimed: 'That is indeed music! it is like that which we hear of in ancient story, which was so exquisite that the hearers became insensible (behosh).'\n 1780. -- \"The bagpipe appears also to be a favourite instrument among the natives.

We get this word from the Lat. muschus, Greek MO/SXOS, and the latter must have been got, probably through Persian, from the Skt. mushka, the literal meaning of which is rendered in the old English phrase 'a cod of musk.' The oldest known European mention of the article is that which we give from St. Jerome; the oldest medical prescription is in a work of Aetius, of Amida (c. 540). In the quotation from Cosmas the word used is MO/SXOS, and kast\u016bri is a Skt. name, still, according to Royle, applied to the musk-deer in the Him\u0101laya. The transfer of the name to (or from) the article called by the Greeks KASTO/RION, which is an analogous product of the beaver, is curious. The Musk-deer (Moschus moschiferus, L.) is found throughout the Him\u0101laya at elevations rarely (in summer) below 8000 feet, and extends east to the borders of Szechuen, and north to Siberia.\n c. 390. -- \"Odoris autem suavitas, et diversa thymiamata, et amomum, et cyphi, oenanthe, muscus, et peregrini muris pellicula, quod dissolutis et amatoribus conveniat, nemo nisi dissolutus negat.\" -- St. Jerome, in Lib.

It diffuses a strong musky odour, so penetrative that it is commonly asserted to affect bottled beer by running over the bottles in a cellar. As Jerdon judiciously observes, it is much more probable that the corks have been affected before being used in bottling; [and Blanford (Mammalia, 237) writes that \"the absurd story . . . is less credited in India than it formerly was, owing to the discovery that liquors bottled in Europe and exported to India are not liable to be tainted.\"] When the female is in heat she is often seen to be followed by a string of males giving out the odour strongly.

The surf boat used on the Coromandel Coast; of capacious size, and formed of planks sewn together with coir-twine; the open joints being made good with a caulking or wadding of twisted coir. The origin of the word is very obscure. Leyden thought it was derived from \"masoula . . . the Mahratta term for fish\" (Morton's Life of Leyden, 64). As a matter of fact the Mahr. word for fish is m\u0101sol\u012b, Konk. m\u0103s\u016bl\u012b. This etymology is substantially adopted by Bp. Heber (see below); [and by the compiler of the Madras Gloss., who gives Tel. m\u0101s\u016bla, Hind. machhl\u012b]. But it may be that the word is some Arabic sea-term not in the dictionaries. Indeed, if the term used by C. Federici (below) be not a clerical error, it suggests a possible etymology from the Ar. masad, 'the fibrous bark of the palmtree, a rope made of it.' Another suggestion is from the Ar. mau\u1e63\u016bl, 'joined,' as opposed to 'dug-out,' or canoes; or possibly it may be from ma\u1e25s\u016bl, 'tax,' if these boats were subject to a tax. Lastly it is possible that the name may be connected with Masulipatam (q.v.), where similar boats would seem to have been in use (see Fryer, 26). But these are conjectures. The quotation from Gasparo Balbi gives a good account of the handling of these boats, but applies no name to them.\n c. 1560. -- \"Spaventosa cosa'\u00e8 chi n\u00f5 ha pi\u00f9 visto, l'imbarcare e sbarcar le mercantie e le persone a San Tom\u00e8 . . . adoperano certe barchette fatte aposta molto alte e larghe, ch' essi chiamano Masudi, e sono fatte con tauole sottili, e con corde sottili cusite insieme vna tauola con l'altre,\" &c.

There is always a heavy sea there (San Thom\u00e9), from swell or storm; so the merchandise and passengers are transported from shipboard to the town by certain boats which are sewn with fine cords, and when they approach the beach, where the sea breaks with great violence, they wait till the perilous wave has past, and then, in the interval between one wave and the next, those boatmen pull with great force, and so run ashore; and being there overtaken by the waves they are carried still further up the beach. And the boats do not break, because they give to the wave, and because the beach is covered with sand, and the boats stand upright on their bottoms.\"- G. Balbi, f. 89.\n 1673. -- \"I went ashore in a Mussoola, a Boat wherein ten Men paddle, the two aftermost of whom are Steersmen, using their Paddles instead of a Rudder.

Pt. i. 325, 337, 339). Of both the first and last it may be said that they are among the most teachable of imitative birds, articulating words with great distinctness, and without Polly's nasal tone. We have heard a wild one (probably the first), on a tree in a field, spontaneously echoing the very peculiar call of the black partridge from an adjoining jungle, with unmistakable truth. There is a curious description in Aelian (De Nat. An. xvi. 2) of an Indian talking bird which we thought at one time to be the Myna; but it seems to be nearer the Sh\u0101m\u0101, and under that head the quotation will be found. [Mr. M'Crindle (Invasion of India, 186) is in favour of the Myna.]\n [1590. -- \"The Mynah is twice the size of the Sh\u00e1rak, with glossy black plumage, but with the bill, wattles and tail coverts yellow.

Prof. Newton in Mr. Wheatley's ed. (iv. 118) is inclined to identify this with the Myna, and notes that one of the earliest figures of the bird is by Eleazar Albin (Nat.

A name applied to certain dried fruits and kernels of astringent flavour, but of several species, and not even all belonging to the same Natural Order, which were from an early date exported from India, and had a high reputation in the medieval pharmacopoeia. This they appear (some of them) to retain in native Indian medicine; though they seem to have disappeared from English use and have no place in Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger's great work, the Pharmacographia. They are still, to some extent, imported into England, but for use in tanning and dyeing, not in pharmacy.\n It is not quite clear how the term myrobalan, in this sense, came into use. For the people of India do not seem to have any single name denoting these fruits or drugs as a group; nor do the Arabic dictionaries afford one either (but see further on). *MUROBA/LANOS is spoken of by some ancient authors, e.g. Aristotle, Dioscorides and Pliny, but it was applied by them to one or more fruits* entirely unconnected with the subjects of this article. This name had probably been preserved in the laboratories, and was applied by some early translator of the Arabic writers on Materia Medica to these Indian products. Though we have said that (so far as we can discover) the dictionaries afford no word with the comprehensive sense of Myrobalan, it is probable that the physicians had such a word, and Garcia de Orta, who is trustworthy, says explicitly that the Arab practitioners whom he had consulted applied to the whole class the name delegi, a word which we cannot identify, unless it originated in a clerical error for alelegi, i.e. ihl\u012blaj. The last word may perhaps be taken as covering all myrobalans; for according to the Glossary to Rhazes at Leyden (quoted by Dozy, Suppt. i. 43) it applies to the K\u0101bul\u012b, the yellow, and the black (or Indian), whilst the Emblic is also called Ihl\u012blaj. amlaj.\n In the Kashm\u012br Customs Tariff (in Punjab Trade Report, ccxcvi.) we have entries of\n \"Hulela (Myrobalan). Bulela (Bellerick ditto). Amla (Emblica Phyllanthus).\"\n One of them is generally identified with the seeds of Moringa pterygosperma -- see HORSE RADISH TREE -- the Ben-nuts of old writers, and affording Oil of Ben, used as a basis in perfumery.\n The kinds recognised in the Medieval pharmacopoeia were five, viz.:-\n (1) The Emblic myrobalan; which is the dried astringent fruit of the \u0100nwul\u0101, \u0101nwl\u0101 of Hind., the Emblica officinalis of Gaertner (Phyllanthus Emblica, L., N. O. Euphorbiaceae). The Persian name of this is \u0101mlah, but, as the Arabic amlaj suggests, probably in older Persian amlag, and hence no doubt Emblica. Garcia says it was called by the Arab physicians embelgi (which we should write ambalj\u012b).\n (2) The Belleric Myrobalan; the fruit of Terminalia Bellerica, Roxb. (N.O. Combretaceae), consisting of a small nut enclosed in a thin exterior rind. The Arabic name given in Ibn Baithar is bal\u012blij; in the old Latin version of Avicenna belilegi; and in Persian it is called bal\u012bl and bal\u012bla. Garcia says the Arab physicians called it beleregi (bal\u012brij, and in old Persian probably bal\u012brig) which accounts for Bellerica.\n (3) The Chebulic Myrobalan; the fruit of Terminalia Chebula, Roxb. The derivation of this name which we have given under CHEBULI is confirmed by the Persian name, which is Hal\u012bla-i-K\u0101bul\u012b. It can hardly have been a product of Kabul, but may have been imported into Persia by that route, whence the name; as calicoes got their name from Calicut. Garcia says these myrobalans were called by his Arabs quebulgi. Ibn Baithar calls them hal\u012blaj, and many of the authorities whom he quotes specify them as K\u0101bul\u012b.\n (4) and (5). The Black Myrobalan, otherwise called 'Indian,' and the Yellow or Citrine. These, according to Royle (Essay on Antiq. of Hindoo Medicine, pp. 36-37), were both products of T. Chebula in different states; but this does not seem quite certain. Further varieties were sometimes recognised, and nine are said to be specified in a paper in an early vol. of the Philos. Transactions.* One kind This article we have been unable to find. Dr. Hunter in As. Res. (xi. 182) quotes from a Persian work of Mahommed Husain Shir\u0101zi, communicated to him by Mr. Colebrooke, the names of 6 varieties of Hal\u012bla (or Myrobalan) as afforded in different stages of maturity by the Terminalia Chebula: -- 1. H. Z\u012bra, when just set (from Z\u012bra, cummin seed). 2. H. Jaw\u012b (from Jau, barley). 3. Zang\u012b or Hind\u012b (The Black M.). 4. H. Ch\u012bn\u012b. 5. H. 'Asfar, or Yellow. 6. H. K\u0101bul\u012b, the mature fruit. [See Dr. Murray's article in Watt, Econ. Dict. vi. pt. iv. 33 seqq.]\n called \u1e62\u012bn\u012b or Chinese, is mentioned by one of the authorities of Ibn Baithar, quoted below, and is referred to by Garcia.\n The virtues of Myrobalans are said to be extolled by Charaka, the oldest of the Sanskrit writers on Medicine. Some of the Arabian and Medieval Greek authors, referred to by Royle, also speak of a combination of different kinds of Myrobalan called Tryphera or Tryphala; a fact of great interest. For this is the triphala ('Three-fruits') of Hindu medicine, which appears in Amarakosha (c. A.D. 500), as well as in a prescription of Susruta, the disciple of Charaka, and which is still, it would seem, familiar to the native Indian practitioners. It is, according to Royle, a combination of the black, yellow and Chebulic; but Garcia, who calls it tinepala (t\u012bn-phalin Hind.='Three-fruits'), seems to imply that it consisted of the three kinds known in Goa, viz. citrine (or yellow), the Indian (or black), and the belleric. [Watt, Econ. Dict. vi. pt. iv. 32 seqq.] The emblic, he says, were not used in medicine there, only in tanning, like sumach. The Myrobalans imported in the Middle Ages seem often to have been preserved (in syrup?).\n c.

But Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger (pp. 195, 475) show that some Cassia bark (of the cinnamon kind) was known in the early centuries of our era as KASI/A SURIGGW/DHS and cassia fistularis; whilst the drug now called Cassia Fistula, L., is first noticed by a medical writer of Constantinople towards A. D. 1300. Pegolotti, at p. 366, gives a few lines of instruction for judging of cassia fistula: \"It ought to be black, and thick, and unbroken (salda), and heavy, and the thicker it is, and the blacker the outside rind is, the riper and better it is; and it retains its virtue well for 2 years.\" This is not very decisive, but on the whole we should suppose Pegolotti's cassia fistula to be either a spice-bark, or solid twigs of a like plant (H. & F. 476).\n This is probably Balanitis aegyptiaca, Delile, the zak of the Arabs, which is not unlike myrobalan fruit and yields an oil much used medicinally.
