A rocky cape, covering a small harbour and a town with old fortifications, in the S.W. of Ceylon, familiar to all Anglo-Indians for many years as a coaling-place of mail-steamers. The Portuguese gave the town for crest a cock (Gallo), a legitimate pun. The serious derivations of the name are numerous. Pridham says that it is Galla, 'a Rock,' which is probable. But Chitty says it means 'a Pound,' and was so called according to the Malabars (i.e. Tamil people) from \". . . this part of the country having been anciently set aside by Ravana for the breeding of his cattle\" (Ceylon Gazetteer, 1832, p. 92). Tennent again says it was called after a tribe, the Gallas, inhabiting the neighbouring district (see ii. 105, &c.). [Prof. Childers (5 ser. Notes & Queries, iii. 155) writes: \"In Sinhalese it is G\u0101lla, the etymology of which is unknown; but in any case it can have nothing to do with 'rock,' the Sinhalese for which is gala with a short a and a single l.\"] Tennent has been entirely misled by Reinaud in supposing that Galle could be the Kala of the old Arab voyages to China, a port which certainly lay in the Malay seas.

The name applied to a kind of galley, or war-boat with oars, of small draught of water, which continued to be employed on the west coast of India down to the latter half of the 18th century. The work quoted below under 1717 explains the galleywatts to be \"large boats like Gravesend Tilt-boats; they carry about 6 Carvel-Guns and 60 men at small arms, and Oars; They sail with a Peak Sail like the Mizen of a Man-of-War, and row with 30 or 40 Oars. . . . They are principally used for landing Troops for a Descent. . . .\" (p. 22). The word is highly interesting from its genealogical tree; it is a descendant of the great historical and numerous family of the Galley (galley, galiot, galleon, galeass, galleida, galeoncino, &c.), and it is almost certainly the immediate parent of the hardly less historical Jolly-boat, which plays so important a part in British naval annals. [Prof. Skeat takes jolly-boat to be an English adaptation of Danish jolle, 'a yawl'; Mr. Foster remarks that jollyvatt as an English word, is at least as old as 1495-97 (Oppenheim, Naval Accounts and Inventories, Navy Rec. Soc. viii. 193) (Letters, iii. 296).] If this be true, which we can hardly doubt, we shall have three of the boats of the British man-of-war owing their names (quod minime reris!) to Indian originals, viz. the Cutter, the Dingy, and the Jolly-boat to catur, dingy and gallevat. This last derivation we take from Sir J. Campbell's Bombay Gazetteer (xiii. 417), a work that one can hardly mention without admiration. This writer, who states that a form of the same word, galbat, is now generally used by the natives in Bombay waters for large foreign vessels, such as English ships and steamers, is inclined to refer it to jalba, a word for a small boat used on the shores of the Red Sea (see Dozy and Eng., p. 276), which appears below in a quotation from Ibn Batuta, and which vessels were called by the early Portuguese geluas. Whether this word is the parent of galley and its derivatives, as Sir J. Campbell thinks, must be very doubtful, for galley is much older in European use than he seems to think, as the quotation from Asser shows. The word also occurs in Byzantine writers of the 9th century, such as the Continuator of Theophanes quoted below, and the Emperor Leo. We shall find below the occurrence of galley as an Oriental word in the form jalia, which looks like an Arabized adoption from a Mediterranean tongue. The Turkish, too, still has \u1e33\u0101ly\u016bn for a ship of the line, which is certainly an adoption from galeone. The origin of galley is a very obscure question. Amongst other suggestions mentioned by Diez (Etym. Worterb., 2nd ed. i. 198 199) is one from GALEO/S, a shark, or from GALEW/THS, a sword-fish -- the latter very suggestive of a galley with its aggressive beak; another is from GA/LH, a word in Hesychius, which is the apparent origin of 'gallery.' It is possible that galeota, galiote, may have been taken directly from the shark or sword-fish, though in imitation of the galea already in use. For we shall see below that galiot was used for a pirate. [The N.E.D. gives the European synonymous words, and regards the ultimate etymology of galley as unknown.]\n The word gallevat seems to come directly from the galeota of the Portuguese and other S. European nations, a kind of inferior galley with only one bank of oars, which appears under the form galion in Joinville, infra (not to be confounded with the galleons of a later period, which were larger vessels), and often in the 13th and 14th centuries as galeota, galiotes, &c. It is constantly mentioned as forming part of the Portuguese fleets in India. Bluteau defines galeota as \"a small galley with one mast, and with 15 or 20 benches a side, and one oar to each bench.\"\n a. Galley.\n c. 865. -- \"And then the incursion of the Russians (TW=N *(PW\\S) afflicted the Roman territory (these are a Scythian nation of rude and savage character), devastating Pontus . . . and investing the City itself when Michael was away engaged in war with the Ishmaelites. . . .

This is a convenient name which has been adopted of late years as a generic name for the existing Aryan languages of India, i.e. those which are radically sprung from; or cognate to, the Sanskrit. The name (according to Mr. E. L. Brandreth) was given by Prof. Hoernle; but it is in fact an adoption and adaptation of a term used by the Pundits of Northern India. They divide the colloquial languages of (civilised) India into the 5 Gau\u1e5bas and 5 Dr\u0101viras [see DRAVIDIAN]. The Gau\u1e5bas of the Pundits appear to be (1) Bengalee (Bang\u0101l\u012b) which is the proper language of Gau\u1e0da, or Northern Bengal, from which the name is taken (see GOUR c.), (2) O\u1e5biya, the language of Orissa, (3) Hind\u012b, (4) Panj\u0101b\u012b, (5) Sindh\u012b; their Dr\u0101vira languages are (1) Telinga, (2) Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6daka (Canarese), (3) Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, (4) Gurjara (Gujar\u0101t\u012b), (5) Dr\u0101vira (Tamil). But of these last (3) and (4) are really to be classed with the Gau\u1e5bian group, so that the latter is to be considered as embracing 7 principal languages. Kashm\u012br\u012b, Singhalese, and the languages or dialects of Assam, of Nepaul, and some others, have also been added to the list of this class.\n The extraordinary analogies between the changes in grammar and phonology from Sanskrit in passing into those Gaurian languages, and the changes of Latin in passing into the Romance languages, analogies extending into minute details, have been treated by several scholars; and a very interesting view of the subject is given by Mr. Brandreth in vols. xi. and xii. of the J.R.A.S., N.S.\n", "gautama": "n.p.

This word is a corruption of the Portuguese Gentio, 'a gentile' or heathen, which they applied to the Hindus in contradistinction to the Moros or 'Moors,' i.e. Mahommedans. [See MOOR.] Both terms are now obsolete among English people, except perhaps that Gentoo still lingers at Madras in the sense b; for the terms Gentio and Gentoo were applied in two senses:\n a. To the Hind\u016bs generally.\n b. To the Telugu-speaking Hind\u016bs of the Peninsula specially, and to their language.\n The reason why the term became thus specifically applied to the Telugu people is probably because, when the Portuguese arrived, the Telugu monarchy of Vijayanagara, or Bijanagar (see BISNAGAR, NARSINGA) was dominant over great part of the Peninsula. The officials were chiefly of Telugu race, and thus the people of this race, as the most important section of the Hind\u016bs, were par excellence the Gentiles, and their language the Gentile language. Besides these two specific senses, Gentio was sometimes used for heathen in general. Thus in F. M. Pinto: \"A very famous Corsair who was called Hinimilau, a Chinese by nation, and who from a Gentio as he was, had a little time since turned Moor. . . .\" -- Ch.

One of the most famous of the tribes of Afghanistan, and probably the strongest, occupying the high plateau north of Kandahar, and extending (roundly speaking) eastward to the Sulim\u0101n\u012b mountains, and north to the K\u0101bul River. They were supreme in Afghanistan at the beginning of the 18th century, and for a time possessed the throne of Ispahan. The following paragraph occurs in the article AFGHANISTAN, in the 9th ed. of the Encyc. Britan., 1874 (i. 235), written by one of the authors of this book:-\n \"It is remarkable that the old Arab geographers of the 10th and 11th centuries place in the Ghilzai country\" (i.e. the country now occupied by the Ghilzais, or nearly so) \"a people called Khilijis, whom they call a tribe of Turks, to whom belonged a famous family of Delhi Kings. The probability of the identity of the Khilijis and Ghilzais is obvious, and the question touches others regarding the origin of the Afghans; but it does not seem to have been gone into.\"\n Nor has the writer since ever been able to go into it. But whilst he has never regarded the suggestion as more than a probable one, he has seen no reason to reject it. He may add that on starting the idea to Sir Henry Rawlinson (to whom it seemed new), a high authority on such a question, though he would not accept it, he made a candid remark to the effect that the Ghilzais had undoubtedly a very Turk-like aspect. A belief in this identity was, as we have recently noticed, entertained by the traveller Charles Masson, as is shown in a passage quoted below. And it has also been maintained by Surgeon-Major Bellew, in his Races of Afghanistan (1880), [who (p. 100) refers the name to Khilich\u012b, a swordsman. The folk etymology of De Guignes and D'Herbelot is Kall, 'repose,' atz, 'hungry,' given to an officer by Ogouz Kh\u0101n, who delayed on the road to kill game for his sick wife].\n All the accounts of the Ghilzais indicate great differences between them and the other tribes of Afghanistan; whilst there seems nothing impossible, or even unlikely, in the partial assimilation of a Turki tribe in the course of centuries to the Afghans who surround them, and the consequent assumption of a quasi-Afghan genealogy. We do not find that Mr. Elphinstone makes any explicit reference to the question now before us. But two of the notes to his History (5th ed. p. 322 and 384) seem to indicate that it was in his mind. In the latter of these he says: \"The Khiljis . . . though Turks by descent . . . had been so long settled among the Afghans that they had almost become identified with that people; but they probably mixed more with other nations, or at least with their Turki brethren, and would be more civilized than the generality of Afghan mountaineers.\" The learned and eminently judicious William Erskine was also inclined to accept the identity of the two tribes, doubting (but perhaps needlessly) whether the Khiliji had been really of Turki race. We have not been able to meet with any translated author who mentions both Khiliji and Ghilzai. In the following quotations all the earlier refer to Khiliji, and the later to Ghilzai. Attention may be called to the expressions in the quotation from Z\u012baudd\u012bn Barn\u012b, as indicating some great difference between the Turk proper and the Khiliji even then. The language of Baber, again, so far as it goes, seems to indicate that by his time the Ghilzais were regarded as an Afghan clan.\n c. 940. -- \"Hajj\u0101j had delegated 'Abdarrahm\u0101n ibn Mahommed ibn al-Ash'ath to Sijist\u0101n, Bost and Rukh\u0101j (Arachosia) to make war on the Turk tribes diffused in those regions, and who are known as Gh\u016bz and Khulj . . .\" -- Mas'\u016bd\u012b, v. 302.\n c. 950. -- \"The Khalaj is a Turk\u012b tribe, which in ancient times migrated into the country that lies between India and the parts of Sijist\u0101n beyond the Gh\u016br.

We get this word from the Arabic z\u0101njab\u012bl, Sp. agengibre (al-z\u0101njab\u012bl), Port. gingibre, Latin zingiber, Ital. zenzero, gengiovo, and many other old forms.\n The Skt. name is s\u1e5bi\u00f1gavera, professedly connected with s\u1e5bi\u00f1ga, 'a horn,' from the antler-like form of the root. But this is probably an introduced word shaped by this imaginary etymology. Though ginger is cultivated all over India, from the Him\u0101laya to the extreme south,* the best is grown in Malabar, and in the language \"Rheede says: 'Etiam in sylvis et desertis reperitur' (Hort. Mal. xi. 10). But I am not aware of any botanist having found it wild. I suspect that no one has looked for it.\" -- Sir J. D. Hooker.\n of that province (Malay\u0101lam) green ginger is called inchi and inchi-ver, from inchi, 'root.' Inchi was probably in an earlier form of the language si\u00f1chi or chi\u00f1chi, as we find it in Canarese still s\u016bnti, which is perhaps the true origin of the H. sonth for 'dry ginger,' [more usually connected with Skt. su\u1e47\u1e6dhi, su\u1e47\u1e6dh, 'to dry'].\n It would appear that the Arabs, misled by the form of the name, attributed z\u0101njab\u012bl or zinjab\u012bl, or ginger, to the coast of Zinj or Zanzibar; for it would seem to be ginger which some Arabic writers speak of as 'the plant of Zinj.' Thus a poet quoted by Kazw\u012bn\u012b enumerates among the products of India the shajr al-Z\u0101nij or Arbor Zingitana, along with shishamwood, pepper, steel, &c. (see Gildemeister, 218). And Abulfeda says also: \"At Melinda is found the plant of Zinj\" (Geog. by Reinaud, i. 257). In Marino Sanudo's map of the world also (c. 1320) we find a rubric connecting Zinziber with Zinj. We do not indeed find ginger spoken of as a product of eastern continental Africa, though Barbosa says a large quantity was produced in Madagascar, and Varthema says the like of the Comoro Islands.\n c.

A kind of stuff, defined in the Draper's Dictionary as made from cotton yarn dyed before being woven. The Indian ginghams were apparently sometimes of cotton mixt with some other material. The origin of this word is obscure, and has been the subject of many suggestions. Though it has long passed into the English language, it is on the whole most probable that, like chintz and calico, the term was one originating in the Indian trade.\n We find it hardly possible to accept the derivation, given by Littr\u00e9, from \"Guingamp, ville de Bretagne, o\u00f9 il y a des fabriques de tissus.\" This is also alleged, indeed, in the Encycl. Britannica, 8th ed., which states, under the name of Guingamp, that there are in that town manufactures of ginghams, to which the town gives its name. [So also in 9th ed.] We may observe that the productions of Guingamp, and of the C\u00f4tes-du-Nord generally, are of linen, a manufacture dating from the 15th century. If it could be shown that gingham was either originally applied to linen fabrics, or that the word occurs before the Indian trade began, we should be more willing to admit the French etymology as possible.\n The Penny Cyclopaedia suggests a derivation from guingois, 'awry.' \"The variegated, striped, and crossed patterns may have suggested the name.\"\n 'Civilis,' a correspondent of Notes and Queries (5 ser. ii. 366, iii. 30) assigns the word to an Indian term, gingh\u0101m, a stuff which he alleges to be in universal use by Hindu women, and a name which he constantly found, when in judicial employment in Upper India, to be used in inventories of stolen property and the like. He mentions also that in Sir G. Wilkinson's Egypt, the word is assigned to an Egyptian origin. The alleged Hind. word is unknown to us and to the dictionaries; if used as 'Civilis' believes, it was almost certainly borrowed from the English term.\n It is likely enough that the word came from the Archipelago. Jansz's Javanese Dict. gives \"ginggang, a sort of striped or chequered East Indian lijnwand,\" the last word being applied to cotton as well as linen stuffs, equivalent to French toile. The verb ginggang in Javanese is given as meaning 'to separate, to go away,' but this seems to throw no light on the matter; nor can we connect the name with that of a place on the northern coast of Sumatra, a little E. of Acheen, which we have seen written Gingham (see Bennett's Wanderings, ii. 5, 6; also Elmore, Directory to India and China Seas, 1802, pp. 63-64). This place appears prominently as Gingion in a chart by W. Herbert, 1752. Finally, Bluteau gives the following: -- \"Guingam. So in some parts of the kingdom (Portugal) they call the excrement of the Silkworm, Bombicis excrementum. Guinga\u0303o. A certain stuff which is made in the territories of the Mogul. Beirames, guingoens, Canequis, &c. (Godinho, Viagam da India, 44).\" Wilson gives kindan as the Tamil equivalent of gingham, and perhaps intends to suggest that it is the original of this word. The Tamil Dict. gives \"kin\u1e0dan, a kind of coarse cotton cloth, striped or chequered.\" [The Madras Gloss. gives Can. ginta, Tel. gintena, Tam. kin\u1e0dan, with the meaning of \"double-thread texture.\" The N.E.D., following Scott, Malayan Words in English, 142 seq., accepts the Javanese derivation as given above: \"Malay ginggang . . . a striped or checkered cotton fabric known to Europeans in the East as 'gingham.' As an adjective, the word means, both in Malay and Javanese, where it seems to be original, 'striped.' The full expression is k\u0101in ginggang, 'striped cloth' (Grashuis). The Tamil 'kin\u1e0dan, a kind of coarse cotton cloth, striped or chequered' (quoted in Yule), cannot be the source of the European forms, nor, I think, of the Malayan forms. It must be an independent word, or a perversion of the Malayan term.\" On the other hand, Prof. Skeat rejects the Eastern derivation on the ground that \"no one explains the spelling. The right explanation is simply that gingham is an old English spelling of Guingamp. See the account of the 'towne of Gyngham' in the Paston Letters, ed. Gairdner, iii. 357.\" (8th ser.

The Pers. surn\u0101pa, zurn\u0101pa, seems to be a form curiously divergent of the same word, perhaps nearer the original. The older Italians sometimes make giraffa into seraph. It is not impossible that the latter word, in its biblical use, may be radically connected with giraffe.\n The oldest mention of the animal is in the Septuagint version of Deut. xiv. 5, where the word z\u0103m\u0103r, rendered in the English Bible 'chamois,' is translated KAMHLOPA/RDALIS; and so also in the Vulgate camelopardalus, [probably the 'wild goat' of the Targums, not the giraffe (Encycl. Bibl. i. 722)]. We quote some other ancient notices of the animal, before the introduction of the word before us:\n c. B.C. 20. -- \"The animals called camelopards (KAMHLOPARDA/LEIS) present a mixture of both the animals comprehended in this appellation. In size they are smaller than camels, and shorter in the neck; but in the distinctive form of the head and eyes. In the curvature of the back again they have some resemblance to a camel, but in colour and hair, and in the length of tail, they are like panthers.\" -- Diodorus, ii. 51.\n c. A.D. 20. -- \"Camelleopards (KAMHLOPAR- DA/LEIS) are bred in these parts, but they do not in any respect resemble leopards, for their variegated skin is more like the streaked and spotted skin of fallow deer. The hinder quarters are so very much lower than the fore quarters, that it seems as if the animal sat upon its rump. . . . It is not, however, a wild animal, but rather like a domesticated beast; for it shows no sign of a savage disposition.\" -- Strabo, Bk. XVI. iv. \u0015 18, E.T. by Hamilton and Falconer.\n c.

The head was in form like that of a camel, but in size more than twice that of a Libyan ostrich. . . .

Gov\u0101 or Kuva was an ancient name of the southern Konkan (see in H. H. Wilson's Works, Vishnu Purana, ii. 164, note 20). We find the place called by the Turkish admiral Sidi 'Ali Gowai-Sand\u0101b\u016br, which may mean \"Sand\u0101b\u016br of Gova.\"\n 1391. -- In a copper grant of this date (S. 1313) we have mention of a chief city of Kankan (see CONCAN) called Gowa and Gow\u0101p\u016bra. See the grant as published by Major Legrand Jacob in J. Bo. Br. R. As. Soc. iv. 107. The translation is too loose to make it worth while to transcribe a quotation; but it is interesting as mentioning the reconquest of Goa from the Turushkas, i.e. Turks or foreign Mahommedans.

Skt. God\u0101var\u012b, 'giving kine.' Whether this name of northern etymology was a corruption of some indigenous name we know not. [The Dravidian name of the river is Goday (Tel. gode, 'limit'), of which the present name is possibly a corruption. ] It is remarkable how the Godavery is ignored by writers and mapmakers till a comparatively late period, with the notable exception of D. Joa\u0303o de Castro, in a work, however, not published till 1843. Barros, in his trace of the coasts of the Indies (Dec. I. ix. cap. 1), mentions Gudavarij as a place adjoining a cape of the same name (which appears in some much later charts as C. Gordewar), but takes no notice of the great river, so far as we are aware, in any part of his history. Linschoten also speaks of the Punto de Guadovaryn, but not of the river. Nor does his map show the latter, though showing the Kistna distinctly. The small general map of India in \"Cambridge's Acc. of the War in India,\" 1761, confounds the sources of the Godavery with those of the Mahanadi (of Orissa) and carries the latter on to combine with the western rivers of the Ganges Delta. This was evidently the prevailing view until Rennell published the first edition of his Memoir (1783), in which he writes:\n \"The Godavery river, or Gonga Godowry, commonly called Ganga in European maps, and sometimes Gang in Indian histories, has generally been represented as the same river with that of Cattack.\n \"As we have no authority that I can find for supposing it, the opinion must have been taken up, on a supposition that there was no opening between the mouths of the Kistna and Mahanadee (or Cattack river) of magnitude sufficient for such a river as the Ganga\" (pp. 74-75) [also ibid. 2nd ed. 244]. As to this error see also a quotation from D'Anville under KEDGEREE. It is probable that what that geographer says in his \u00c9claircissemens, p. 135, that he had no real idea of the Godavery. That name occurs in his book only as \"la pointe de Gaudewari.\" This point, he says, is about E.N.E. of the \"river of Narsapur,\" at a distance of about 12 leagues; \"it is a low land, intersected by several riverarms, forming the mouths of that which the maps, esteemed to be most correct, call Wenseron; and the river of Narsapur is itself one of those arms, according to a MS. map in my possession.\" Narsaparam is the name of a taluk on the westernmost delta branch, or Vasishta God\u0101var\u012b [see Morris, Man. of Godavery Dist., 193]. Wenseron appears on a map in Baldaeus (1672), as the name of one of the two mouths of the Eastern or Gautam\u012b God\u0101var\u012b, entering the sea near Coringa. It is perhaps the same name as Injaram on that branch, where there was an English Factory for many years.\n In the neat map of \"Regionum Choromandel, Golconda, et Orixa,\" which is in Baldaeus (1672), there is no indication of it whatever except as a short inlet from the sea called Gondewary.\n 1538. -- \"The noblest rivers of this province (Daquem or Deccan) are six in number, to wit: Crusna (Krishna), in many places known as Hinapor, because it passes by a city of this name (Hindap\u016br?); Bivra (read Bima?); these two rivers join on the borders of the Deccan and the land of Canara (q.v.), and after traversing great distances enter the sea in the Oria territory; Malaprare (Malprabha?); Guodavam (read Guodavari) otherwise called Gangua; Purnadi; Tapi. Of these the Malaprare enters the sea in the Oria territory, and so does the Guodavam; but Purnadi and Tapi enter the Gulf of Cambay at different points.\" -- Joa\u0303o de Castro, Primeiro Roteiro da Costa da India, pp. 6, 7.\n c. 1590. -- \"Here (in Berar) are rivers in abundance; especially the Ganga of Gotam, which they also call Godov\u0101r\u012b.

A warehouse for goods and stores; an outbuilding used for stores; a store-room. The word is in constant use in the Chinese ports as well as in India. The H. and Beng. gud\u0101m is apparently an adoption of the Anglo-Indian word, not its original. The word appears to have passed to the continent of India from the eastern settlements, where the Malay word gadong is used in the same sense of 'store-room,' but also in that of 'a house built of brick or stone.' Still the word appears to have come primarily from the South of India, where in Telugu gi\u1e0da\u1e45gi, gi\u1e0d\u1e0dangi, in Tamil ki\u1e0da\u1e45gu, signify 'a place where goods lie,' from ki\u1e0du, 'to lie.' It appears in Singhalese also as gud\u0101ma. It is a fact that many common Malay and Javanese words are Tamil, or only to be explained by Tamil. Free intercourse between the Coromandel Coast and the Archipelago is very ancient, and when the Portuguese first appeared at Malacca they found there numerous settlers from S. India (see s.v. KLING).

The old name in European documents of the place on the Persian Gulf now known as Bandar' Abb\u0101s, or 'Abb\u0101s\u012b. The latter name was given to it when Sh\u0101h 'Abb\u0101s, after the capture and destruction of the island city of Hormuz, established a port there. The site which he selected was the little town of Gamr\u016bn. This had been occupied by the Portuguese, who took it from the 'King of Lar' in 1612, but two years later it was taken by the Sh\u0101h. The name is said (in the Geog. Magazine, i. 17) to be Turkish, meaning 'a Custom House.' The word alluded to is probably gumruk, which has that meaning, and which is again, through Low Greek, from the Latin commercium. But this etymology of the name seems hardly probable. That indicated in the extract from A. Hamilton below is from Pers. Kamr\u016bn, 'a shrimp,' or Port. camara\u0303o, meaning the same.\n The first mention of Gombroon in the E. I. Papers seems to be in 1616, when Edmund Connok, the Company's chief agent in the Gulf, calls it \"Gombraun, the best port in all Persia,\" and \"that hopeful and glorious port of Gombroon\" (Sainsbury, i. 484-5; [Foster, Letters, iv. 264]). There was an English factory here soon after the capture of Hormuz, and it continued to be maintained in 1759, when it was taken by the Comte d'Estaing.

[\"The word gong is often said to be Chinese. Clifford and Swettenham so mark it; but no one seems to be able to point out the Chinese original\" (Scott, Malayan Words in English, 53).] Its well-known application is to a disk of thin bell-metal, which when struck with a mallet, yields musical notes, and is used in the further east as a substitute for a bell. [\"The name gong, agong, is considered to be imitative or suggestive of the sound which the instrument produces\" (Scott, loc. cit. 51).] Marcel Devic says that the word exists in all the languages of the Archipelago; [for the variants see Scott, loc. cit.]. He defines it as meaning \"instrument de musique aussi appel\u00e9 tam-tam\"; but see under TOM-TOM. The great drum, to which Dampier applies the name, was used like the metallic gong for striking the hour. Systems of gongs variously arranged form harmonious musical instruments among the Burmese, and still more elaborately among the Javanese.\n The word is commonly applied by Anglo-Indians also to the H. ghan\u1e6d\u0101 (gan\u1e6da, Dec.) or gha\u1e5b\u012b, a thicker metal disc, not musical, used in India for striking the hour (see GHURRY).

H. gau. An ancient measure of distance preserved in S. India and Ceylon. In the latter island, where the term still is in use, the gawwa is a measure of about 4 English miles.

This is doubtless a form of the same term as that under consideration, but the explanation is probably modern and incorrect. The yojana with which the gau is correlated, appears etymologically to be 'a yoking,' viz. \"the stage, or distance to be gone in one harnessing without unyoking\" (Williams); and the lengths attributed to it are very various, oscillating from 2\u00bd to 9 miles, and even to 8 kro\u015bas (see COSS).

This name, now almost obsolete, was applied to a kind of vessel which is constantly mentioned in the seaand river-fights of India, from the arrival of the Portuguese down to near the end of the 18th century. That kind of etymology which works from inner consciousness would probably say: \"This term has always been a puzzle to the English in India. The fact is that it was a kind of vessel much used by corsairs, who were said to grab all that passed the sea. Hence,\" &c. But the real derivation is different.\n The Rev. Howard Malcom, in a glossary attached to his Travels, defines it as \"a square-rigged Arab vessel, having a projecting stern (stem?) and no bowsprit; it has two masts.\" Probably the application of the term may have deviated variously in recent days. [See Bombay Gazetteer, xiii. pt. i. 348.] For thus again in Solvyns (Les Hindous, vol. i.) a grab is drawn and described as a ship with three masts, a sharp prow, and a bowsprit. But originally the word seems, beyond question, to have been an Arab name for a galley. The proper word is Arab. ghor\u0101b, 'a raven,' though adopted into Mahratti and Konkani as gur\u0101b. Jal says, quoting Reinaud, that ghor\u0101b was the name given by the Moors to the true galley, and cites Hyde for the rationale of the name. We give Hyde's words below. Amari, in a work quoted below (p. 397), points out the analogous corvetta as perhaps a transfer of ghur\u0101b:\n 1181. -- \"A vessel of our merchants . . . making sail for the city of Tripoli (which God protect) was driven by the winds on the shore of that country, and the crew being in want of water, landed to procure it, but the people of the place refused it unless some corn were sold to them. Meanwhile there came a ghur\u0101b from Tripoli . . . which took and plundered the crew, and seized all the goods on board the vessel.\"* -- Arabic Letter from Ubaldo, Archbishop and other authorities of Pisa, to the Almohad Caliph Abu Yak'ub Yusuf, in Amari, Diplomi Arabi, p. 8.\n The Latin contemporary version runs thus:\n \"Cum quidam nostri cari cives de Sicilia\u0302 cum carico frumenti ad Tripolim venirent, tempestate maris et vi ventorum compulsi, ad portum dictum Macri devenerunt; ibique aqua\u0302 deficiente, et cum pro ea\u0302 aurienda\u0302 irent, Barbarosi non permiserunt eos . . . nisi prius eis de frumento venderent.

It is the Ital. cece, Fr. pois chiche, Eng. chick-pea or Egypt. pea, much used in France and S. Europe. This specific application of gra\u0303o is also Portuguese, as appears from Bluteau. The word gram is in some parts of India applied to other kinds of pulse, and then this application of it is recognised by qualifying it as Bengal gram. (See remarks under CALAVANCE.)

This name is now generally applied to a kind of cambric from China made from the Chuma of the Chinese (Boehmaria nivea, Hooker, the Rhea, so much talked of now), and called by the Chinese sia-pu, or 'summer-cloth.' We find grass-cloths often spoken of by the 16th century travellers, and even later, as an export from Orissa and Bengal.

This is probably a corruption representing the H. gh\u0101skhod\u0101 or gh\u0101sk\u0101\u1e6d\u0101, 'the digger, or cutter, of grass'; the title of a servant employed to collect grass for horses, one such being usually attached to each horse besides the syce or horsekeeper. In the north the grasscutter is a man; in the south the office is filled by the horsekeeper's wife. Gh\u0101ska\u1e6d is the form commonly used by Englishmen in Upper India speaking Hindustani; but ghasiy\u0101r\u0101 by those aspiring to purer language. The former term appears in Williamson's V. M. (1810) as gauskot (i. 186), the latter in Jacquemont's Correspondence as grassyara. No grasscutters are mentioned as attached to the stables of Akbar; only a money allowance for grass. The antiquity of the Madras arrangement is shown by a passage in Castanheda (1552): \" . . . he gave him a horse, and a boy to attend to it, and a female slave to see to its fodder.\"- (ii. 58.)\n 1789. -- \". . . an Horsekeeper and Grasscutter at two pagodas.\" -- Munro's Narr. 28.\n 1793. -- \"Every horse . . . has two attendants, one who cleans and takes care of him, called the horse-keeper, and the other the grasscutter, who provides for his forage.\" -- Dirom's Narr. 242.\n 1846. -- \"Every horse has a man and a maid to himself -- the maid cuts grass for him; and every dog has a boy.

See Mr. Grey's note on P. della Valle, Hak. Soc. ii. 218.]\n", "grass-widow": "s. This slang phrase is applied in India, with a shade of malignity, to ladies living apart from their husbands, especially as recreating at the Hill stations, whilst the husbands are at their duties in the plains.\n We do not know the origin of the phrase. In the Slang Dictionary it is explained: \"An unmarried mother; a deserted mistress.\" But no such opprobrious meanings attach to the Indian use. In Notes and Queries, 6th ser. viii. 414, will be found several communications on this phrase. [Also see ibid. x. 436, 526; xi. 178; 8th ser. iv. 37, 75.] We learn from these that in Moor's Suffolk Words and Phrases, Grace-Widow occurs with the meaning of an unmarried mother. Corresponding to this, it is stated also, is the N.S. (?) or Low German gras-wedewe. The Swedish Gr\u00e4s\u00e4nka or -enka also is used for 'a low dissolute married woman living by herself.' In Belgium a woman of this description is called haecke-wedewe, from haecken, 'to feel strong desire' (to 'hanker'). And so it is suggested gr\u00e4senka is contracted from gr\u00e4desenka, from gradig, 'esuriens' (greedy, in fact). In Danish Dict. graesenka is interpreted as a woman whose betrothed lover is dead. But the German Stroh-Wittwe, 'strawwidow' (which Fl\u00fcgel interprets as 'mock widow'), seems rather inconsistent with the suggestion that grass-widow is a corruption of the kind suggested. A friend mentions that the masc. Stroh-Wittwer is used in Germany for a man whose wife is absent, and who therefore dines at the eating-house with the young fellows. [The N.E.D. gives the two meanings: 1. An unmarried woman who has cohabited with one or more men; a discarded mistress; 2. A married woman whose husband is absent from her. \"The etymological notion is obscure, but the parallel forms disprove the notion that the word is a 'corruption' of grace-widow. It has been suggested that in sense 1. grass (and G. stroh) may have been used with opposition to bed. Sense 2. may have arisen as an etymologizing interpretation of the compound after it had ceased to be generally understood; in Eng. it seems to have first appeared as Anglo-Indian.\" The French equivalent, Veuve de Malabar, was in allusion to Lemierre's tragedy, produced in 1770.]\n 1878. -- \"In the evening my wife and I went out house-hunting; and we pitched upon one which the newly incorporated body of Municipal Commissioners and the Clergyman (who was a Grass-widower, his wife being at home) had taken between them.\" -- Life in the Mofussil, ii. 99-100.\n 1879. -- The Indian newspaper's \"typical official rises to a late breakfast -- probably on herrings and soda-water -- and dresses tastefully for his round of morning calls, the last on a grass-widow, with whom he has a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate tiffin, where 'pegs' alternate with champagne.\" -- Simla Letter in Times, Aug. 16.\n 1880. -- \"The Grass-widow in Nephelococcygia.\" -- Sir Ali Baba, 169.\n \" \"Pleasant times have these Indian grass-widows!\" -- The World, Jan. 21, 13.\n", "grassia": "s.

Afterwards the term gr\u0101s was also used for the blackmail paid by a village to a turbulent neighbour as the price of his protection and forbearance, and in other like meanings. \"Thus the title of grassia, originally an honourable one, and indicating its possessor to be a cadet of the ruling tribe, became at last as frequently a term of opprobrium, conveying the idea of a professional robber\" (Ibid.

The great lizards, sometimes called guanas in India, are apparently monitors.  It must be observed, however, that approximating Indian names of lizards have helped the confusion. Thus the large monitor to which the name guana is often applied in India, is really called in Hindi goh (Skt. godh\u0101), Singhalese goy\u0101.

The eastern horn of Africa, pointing towards India. We have the name from the Portuguese, and it has been alleged to have been so called by them as meaning, 'Take you heed!' (Gardezvous, in fact.) But this is etymology of the species that so confidently derives 'Bombay' from Boa Bahia. Bruce, again (see below), gives dogmatically an interpretation which is equally unfounded. We must look to history, and not to the 'moral consciousness' of anybody. The country adjoining this horn of Africa, the Regio Aromatum of the ancients, seems to have been called by the Arabs Haf\u016bn, a name which we find in the Periplus in the shape of Opo\u0304n\u0113. This name Haf\u016bn was applied to a town, no doubt the true Opo\u0304n\u0113, which Barbosa (1516) mentions under the name of Afuni, and it still survives in those of two remarkable promontories, viz. the Peninsula of R\u0101s Haf\u016bn (the Chersonnesus of the Periplus, the Zingis of Ptolemy, the Cape d'Affui and d'Orfui of old maps and nautical directories), and the cape of Jard-Haf\u016bn (or according to the Egyptian pronunciation, Gard-Haf\u016bn), i.e. Guardafui. The nearest possible meaning of jard that we can find is 'a wide or spacious tract of land without herbage.' Sir R. Burton (Commentary on Cam\u00f5ens, iv. 489) interprets jard as=Bay, \"from a break in the dreadful granite wall, lately provided by Egypt with a lighthouse. \" The last statement is unfortunately an error. The intended light seems as far off as ever. [There is still no lighthouse, and shipowners differ as to its advantage; see answer by Secretary of State, in House of Commons, Times, March 14, 1902.] We cannot judge of the ground of his interpretation of jard.\n An attempt has been made to connect the name Haf\u016bn with the Arabic af'a, 'pleasant odours.' It would then, be the equivalent of the ancient Reg. Aromatum. This is tempting, but very questionable. We should have mentioned that Guardafui is the site of the mart and Promontory of the Spices described by the author of the Periplus as the furthest point and abrupt termination of the continent of Barbarice (or eastern Africa), towards the Orient (TO\\ TW=N *)ARWMATW/N E)MPO/RION KAI\\ A)KRWTH/RION TELEUTAI=ON TH=S BARBARIKH=S H)PEI/ROU PRO\\S A)NATOLH\\N A)POKO/PON).\n According to C. M\u00fcller our Guardafui is called by the natives R\u0101s Aser; their R\u0101s Jardaf\u016bn being a point some 12 m. to the south, which on some charts is called R\u0101s Shenarif, and which is also the *TA/BAI of the Periplus (Geog.

Myrtaceae; Span. guayava, Fr. goyavier, [from Brazilian guayaba, Stanf. Dict.]), Guayabo pomifera Indica of Caspar Bauhin, Guayava of Joh. Bauhin, strangely appears by name in Elliot's translation from Am\u012br Khosr\u016b, who flourished in the 13th century: \"He who has placed only guavas and quinces in his throat, and has never eaten a plantain, will say it is like so much jujube\" (iii. 556). This must be due to some ambiguous word carelessly rendered. The fruit and its name are alike American. It appears to be the guaiabo of Oviedo in his History of the Indies (we use the Italian version in Ramusio, iii. f. 141v). There is no mention of the guava in either De Orta or Acosta. Amr\u016bd, which is the commonest Hindustani (Pers.) name for the guava, means properly 'a pear'; but the fruit is often called safar\u012b \u0101m, 'journey mango' (respecting which see under ANANAS). And this last term is sometimes vulgarly corrupted into sup\u0101r\u012b \u0101m (areca-mango!). In the Deccan (according to Moodeen Sheriff) and all over Guzerat and the Central Provinces (as we are informed by M.-Gen. Keatinge), the fruit is called j\u0101m, Mahr. jamba, which is in Bengal the name of Syzigium jambolanum (see JAMOON), and in Guzer\u0101ti j\u0101mr\u016bd, which seems to be a factitious word in imitation of \u0101mr\u016bd.\n The guava, though its claims are so inferior to those of the pine-apple (indeed except to stew, or make jelly, it is nobis judicibus, an utter impostor), [Sir Joseph Hooker annotates: \"You never ate good ones!\"] must have spread like that fruit with great rapidity. Both appear in Blochmann's transl. of the \u0100\u012bn (i. 64) as served at Akbar's table; though when the guava is named among the fruits of T\u016br\u0101n, doubts again arise as to the fruit intended, for the word used, amr\u016bd, is ambiguous. In 1688 Dampier mentions guavas at Achin, and in Cochin China. The tree, like the custard-apple, has become wild in some parts of India. See Davidson, below.\n c. 1550. -- \"The guaiava is like a peachtree, with a leaf resembling the laurel . . . the red are better than the white, and are well-flavoured.\" -- Girol.

The Il\u0101h\u012b gaz of Akbar was intended to supersede all these as a standard; and as it was the basis of all records of landmeasurements and rents in Upper India, the determination of its value was a subject of much importance when the revenue surveys were undertaken about 1824.

Ant. xvii. 358) points out that the proper reading is taban.] The product was first brought to notice in 1843 by Dr. Montgomery. It is collected by first ringing the tree and then felling it, and no doubt by this process the article will speedily become extinct. The history of G. P. is, however, far from well known. Several trees are known to contribute to the exported article; their juices being mixed together. [Mr. Scott (Malay Words, 55 seqq.) writes the word getah percha, or getah perchah, 'gum of percha,' and remarks that it has been otherwise explained as meaning 'gum of Sumatra,' \"there being another word percha, a name of Sumatra, as well as a third word percha, 'a rag, a remnant.'\" Mr. Maxwell (loc. cit.) writes: \"It is still uncertain whether there is a gutta producing tree called Percha by the Malays.

Gwalior may be traced back, in Gen. Cunningham's opinion, to the 3rd century of our era. It was the seat of several ancient Hindu dynasties, and from the time of the early Mahommedan sovereigns of Delhi down to the reign of Aurangz\u012bb it was used as a state-prison. Early in the 18th century it fell into the possession of the Mahratta family of Sindhia, whose residence was established to the south of the fortress, in what was originally a camp, but has long been a city known by the original title of Lashkar (camp). The older city lies below the northern foot of the rock. Gwalior has been three times taken by British arms: (1) escaladed by a force under the command of Major Popham in 1780, a very daring feat;* (2) by a regular attack under Gen. White in 1805; (3) most gallantly in June 1858, by a party of the 25th Bombay N. I. under Lieutenants Rose and Waller, in which the former officer fell. After the two first captures the fortress was restored to the Sindhia family. From 1858 it was retained in our hands, but in December 1885 it was formally restored to the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Sindhia.\n The name of the fortress, according to Gen. Cunningham (Archaeol. Survey, ii. 335), is derived from a small Hind\u016b shrine within it dedicated to the hermit Gw\u0101li or Gw\u0101li-p\u0101, after whom the fortress received the name of Gw\u0101li\u0101war, contracted into Gw\u0101li\u0101r.\n c. 1020. -- \"From Kanauj, in travelling south-east, on the western side of the Ganges, you come to Jaj\u00e1hot\u00ed, at a distance of 30 parasangs, of which the capital is Kajur\u00e1ha.
