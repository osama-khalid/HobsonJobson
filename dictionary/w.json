The trade name for a slender yellow bamboo with beautifully regular and short joints, imported from Japan. We cannot give the origin of the term with any conviction. The two following suggestions may embrace or indicate the origin. (1). Rumphius mentions a kind of bamboo called by him Arundinarbor fera, the native name of which is Bulu swangy (see in vol. iv. cap. vii. et seqq.). As buluh is Malay for bamboo, we presume that swangi is also Malay, but we do not know its meaning. (2). Our friend Professor Terrien de la Couperie notes: \"In the K'ang-hi tze-tien, 118, 119, the Huang tchu is described as follows: 'A species of bamboo, very hard, with the joints close together; the skin is as white as snow; the larger kind can be used for boats, and the smaller used for pipes, &c.' See also Wells Williams, Syllabic Dict. of the Chinese Lang. p. 251.\n [On this Professor Giles writes: \"'Whang' clearly stands for 'yellow,' as in Whangpoo and like combinations. The difficulty is with ee, which should stand for some word of that sound in the Cantonese dialect. There is such a word in 'clothes, skin, sheath'; and 'yellow skin (or sheath)' would form just such a combination as the Chinese would be likely to employ. The suggestion of Terrien de la Couperie is not to the purpose.\" So Mr. C. M. Gardner writes: \"The word hwang has many meanings in Chinese according to the tone in which it is said. Hwang-chi t\u00eang or hwangee-t\u00eang might be 'yellow-corticled cane.' The word chuh means 'bamboo,' and hwang-chuh might be 'yellow or Imperial bamboo.' Wan means a 'myriad,' ch'i 'utensil'; wan-chi t\u00eang might mean a kind of cane 'good for all kinds of uses.' Wan-chuh is a particular kind of bamboo from which paper is made in W. Hapei.\"\n Mr. Skeat writes: \"'Buluh swangi' is correct Malay. Favre in his MalayFr. Dict. has 'suw\u0101ngi, esprit, spectre, esprit mauvais.'

[The late Mr. Bridgman of Gorakhpur, whose recollection of India dated from the earlier part of the last century told me that in his younger days the rule at Calcutta was that the guest always arrived at his host's house in the full eveningdress of the time, on which his host meeting him at the door expressed his regret that he had not chosen a cooler dress; on which the guest's Bearer always, as if by accident, appeared from round the corner with a nankeen jacket, which was then and there put on.

This term is constantly applied by the old writers to the rainy season, a usage now quite unknown to Anglo-Indians.

This is an odd name which has attached itself in books to the so-called 'natural steel' of S. India, made especially in Salem, and in some parts of Mysore. It is prepared from small bits of malleable iron (made from magnetic ore) which are packed in crucibles with pieces of a particular wood (Cassia auriculata), and covered with leaves and clay. The word first appears in a paper read before the Royal Society, June 11, 1795, called: \"Experiments and observations to in vestigate the nature of a kind of Steel, manufactured at Bombay, and there called Wootz . . . by George Pearson, M.D.\" This paper is quoted below.\n The word has never since been recognised as the name of steel in any language, and it would seem to have originated in some clerical error, or misreading, very possibly for wook, representing the Canarese ukku (pron. wukku) 'steel.' Another suggestion has been made by Dr. Edward Balfour. He states that uchcha and nicha (Hind. u\u1e45cha-n\u012bcha, in reality for 'high' and 'low') are used in Canarese speaking districts to denote superior and inferior descriptions of an article, and supposes that wootz may have been a misunderstanding of uchcha, 'of superior quality.' The former suggestion seems to us preferable. [The Madras Gloss. gives as local names of steel, Can. ukku, Tel. ukku, Tam. and Malay\u0101l. urukku, and derives wootz from Skt. u\u0107\u0107a, whence comes H. u\u1e45ch\u0101.]\n The article was no doubt the famous 'Indian Steel,' the SI/DHROS *)INDI)KO\\S KAI\\ STO/MWMA of the Periplus, the material of the Indian swords celebrated in many an Arabic poem, the alhinde of old Spanish, the hundw\u0101n\u012b of the Persian traders, ondanique of Marco Polo, the iron exported by the Portuguese in the 16th century from Batical\u00e0 (see BATCUL) in Canara and other parts (see Correa passim).

We give this Bel\u016bch word for loot on the high authority quoted. [On this Mr. M. L. Dames writes: \"This is not, strictly speaking, a Baloch\u012b word, but Sindh\u012b, in the form wag or wagu. The Baloch\u012b word is bag, but I cannot say for certain whether it is borrowed from Sindh\u012b by Balochi, or vice versa\u0302. The meaning, however, is not loot, but 'a herd of camels.' It is probable that on the occasion referred to the loot consisted of a herd of camels, and this would easily give rise to the idea that the word meant loot. It is one of the commonest forms of plunder in those regions, and I have often heard Balochis, when narrating their raids, describe how they had carried off a 'bag.'\"]\n 1845. -- \"In one hunt after wug, as the Beloochees call plunder, 200 of that beautiful regiment, the 2nd Europeans, marched incessantly for 15 hours over such ground as I suppose the world cannot match for ravines, except in places where it is impossible to march at all.\" -- Letter of Sir C.
