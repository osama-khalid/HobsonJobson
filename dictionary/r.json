Skt. r\u0101j\u0101, 'king.' The word is still used in this sense, but titles have a tendency to degenerate, and this one is applied to many humbler dignitaries, petty chiefs, or large Zemindars. It is also now a title of nobility conferred by the British Government, as it was by their Mahommedan predecessors, on Hindus, as Naw\u0101b is upon Moslem. R\u0101\u012b, R\u0101o, R\u0101n\u0101, R\u0101wal, R\u0101ya (in S. India), are other forms which the word has taken in vernacular dialects or particular applications. The word spread with Hindu civilisation to the eastward, and survives in the titles of Indo-Chinese sovereigns, and in those of Malay and Javanese chiefs and princes.\n It is curious that the term R\u0101j\u0101 cannot be traced, so far as we know, in any of the Greek or Latin references to India, unless the very questionable instance of Pliny's Rachias be an exception. In early Mahommedan writers the now less usual, but still Indian, forms R\u0101o\u0304 and R\u0101\u012b, are those which we find. (Ibn Batuta, it will be seen, regards the words for king in India and in Spain as identical, in which he is fundamentally right.) Among the English vulgarisms of the 18th century again we sometimes find the word barbarised into Roger.\n c. 1338. -- \". . .

A town, formerly head-place of a district, on the lower Godavery R. The name is in Telegu R\u0101jamahendravaramu, 'Kingchief('s)-Town,' [and takes its name from Mahendradeva of the Orissa dynasty; see Morris, Godavery Man. 23].\n", "rajpoot": "s. Hind. R\u0101jp\u016bt, from Skt. R\u0101japutra, 'King's Son.' The name of a great race in India, the hereditary profession of which is that of arms. The name was probably only a honorific assumption; but no race in India has furnished so large a number of princely families. According to Chand, the great medieval bard of the R\u0101jp\u016bts, there were 36 clans of the race, issued from four Kshatriyas (Parih\u0101r, Pram\u0101r, Solankh\u012b, and Chauh\u0101n) who sprang into existence from the sacred Agniku\u1e47\u1e0da or Firepit on the summit of Mount Ab\u016b. Later bards give five eponyms from the firepit, and 99 clans. The R\u0101jp\u016bts thus claim to be true Kshatriyas, or representatives of the second of the four fundamental castes, the Warriors; but the Brahmans do not acknowledge the claim, and deny that the true Kshatriya is extant. Possibly the story of the fireborn ancestry hides a consciousness that the claim is factitious. \"The Rajpoots,\" says Forbes, \"use animal food and spirituous liquors, both unclean in the last degree to their puritanic neighbours, and are scrupulous in the observance of only two rules, -- those which prohibit the slaughter of cows, and the remarriage of widows. The clans are not forbidden to eat together, or to intermarry, and cannot be said in these respects to form separate castes\" (R\u0101s-m\u0101l\u0101, reprint 1878, p. 537).\n An odd illustration of the fact that to partake of animal food, and especially of the heroic repast of the flesh of the wild boar killed in the chase (see Terry's representation of this below), is a R\u0101jp\u016bt characteristic, occurs to the memory of one of the present writers. In Lord Canning's time the young R\u0101jp\u016bt R\u0101ja of Alwar had betaken himself to degrading courses, insomuch that the Viceroy felt constrained, in open durbar at Agra, to admonish him. A veteran political officer, who was present, inquired of the agent at the Alwar Court what had been the nature of the conduct thus rebuked. The reply was that the young prince had become the habitual associate of low and profligate Mahommedans, who had so influenced his conduct that among other indications, he would not eat wild pig. The old Political, hearing this, shook his head very gravely, saying, 'Would not eat Wild Pig! Dear! Dear! Dear!' It seemed the ne plus ultra of R\u0101jp\u016bt degradation! The older travellers give the name in the quaint form Rashboot, but this is not confined to Europeans, as the quotation from Sidi 'Al\u00ed shows; though the aspect in which the old English travellers regarded the tribe, as mainly a pack of banditti, might have made us think the name to be shaped by a certain sense of aptness. The Portuguese again frequently call them Reys Butos, a form in which the true etymology, at least partially, emerges.\n 1516. -- \"There are three qualities of these Gentiles, that is to say, some are called Razbutes, and they, in the time that their King was a Gentile, were Knights, the defenders of the Kingdom, and governors of the Country.\" -- Barbosa, 50.\n 1533. -- \"Insomuch that whilst the battle went on, Saladim placed all his women in a large house, with all that he possessed, whilst below the house were combustibles for use in the fight; and Saladim ordered them to be set fire to, whilst he was in it.

This was the same Charter Act that established the Supreme Court. But the authorised compilation of \"Regulations of the Govt. of Fort William in force at the end of 1853,\" begins only with the Regulations of 1793, and makes no allusion to the earlier Regulations. No more does Regulation XLI. of 1793, which prescribes the form, numbering, and codifying of the Regulations to be issued.

The peculiar black loamy soil, commonly called by English people in India 'black cotton soil.' The word may possibly be connected with H. -- P. reg, 'sand'; but rega\u1e0da and rega\u1e0di is given by Wilson as Telugu. [Platts connects it with Skt. rekha, 'a furrow.'] This soil is not found in Bengal, with some restricted exception in the R\u0101jmahal Hills. It is found everywhere on the plains of the Deccan trap-country, except near the coast. Tracts of it are scattered through the valley of the Krishna, and it occupies the flats of Coimbatore, Madura, Salem, Tanjore, Ramn\u0101d, and Tinnevelly. It occurs north of the Nerbudda in Saugor, and occasionally on the plain of the eastern side of the Peninsula, and composes the great flat of Surat and Broach in Guzerat. It is also found in Pegu. The origin of rega\u1e5b has been much debated. We can only give the conclusion as stated in the Manual of the Geology of India, from which some preceding particulars are drawn: \"Regur has been shown on fairly trustworthy evidence to result from the impregnation of certain argillaceous formations with organic matter, but . . . the process which has taken place is imperfectly understood, and . . . some peculiarities in distribution yet require explanation.\" -- Op. cit. i. 434.\n", "reh": "s. [Hind. reh, Skt. rej, 'to shine, shake, quiver.'] A saline efflorescence which comes to the surface in extensive tracts of Upper India, rendering the soil sterile. The salts (chiefly sulphate of soda mixed with more or less of common salt and carbonate of soda) are superficial in the soil, for in the worst reh tracts sweet water is obtainable at depths below 60 or 80 feet. [Plains infested with these salts are very commonly known in N. India as Oosur Plains (Hind. \u016bsar, Skt. \u016bshara, 'impregnated with salt.')] The phenomenon seems due to the climate of Upper India, where the ground is rendered hard and impervious to water by the scorching sun, the parching winds, and the treeless character of the country, so that there is little or no water-circulation in the subsoil. The salts in question, which appear to be such of the substances resulting from the decomposition of rock, or of the detritus derived from rock, and from the formation of the soil, as are not assimilated by plants, accumulate under such circumstances, not being diluted and removed by the natural purifying process of percolation of the rain-water. This accumulation of salts is brought to the surface by capillary action after the rains, and evaporated, leaving the salts as an efflorescence on the surface. From time to time the process culminates on considerable tracts of land, which are thus rendered barren. The canal-irrigation of the Upper Provinces has led to some aggravation of the evil. The level of the canal-waters being generally high, they raise the level of the reh-polluted water in the soil, and produce in the lower tracts a great increase of the efflorescence. A partial remedy for this lies in the provision of drainage for the subsoil water, but this has only to a small extent been yet carried out. [See a full account in Watt, Econ. Dict.

There is a strong temptation to derive the Greek O)RU/ZA, which is the source of our word through It. riso, Fr. riz, etc., from the Tamil ari\u015bi, 'rice deprived of husk,' ascribed to a root ari, 'to separate.' It is quite possible that Southern India was the original seat of rice cultivation. Roxburgh (Flora Indica, ii. 200) says that a wild rice, known as Newaree [Skt. n\u012bv\u0101ra, Tel. nivv\u0101ri] by the Telinga people, grows abundantly about the lakes in the Northern Circars, and he considers this to be the original plant.\n It is possible that the Arabic al-ruzz (arruzz) from which the Spaniards directly take their word arroz, may have been taken also directly from the Dravidian term. But it is hardly possible that O)RU/ZA can have had that origin. The knowledge of rice apparently came to Greece from the expedition of Alexander, and the mention of O)RU/ZA by Theophrastus, which appears to be the oldest, probably dates almost from the lifetime of Alexander (d. B.C. 323). Aristobulus, whose accurate account is quoted by Strabo (see below), was a companion of Alexander's expedition, but seems to have written later than Theophrastus. The term was probably acquired on the Oxus, or in the Punjab. And though no Skt. word for rice is nearer O)RU/ZA than vr\u012bhi, the very common exchange of aspirant and sibilant might easily give a form like vr\u012bsi or br\u012bsi (comp. hind\u016b, sind\u016b, &c.) in the dialects west of India. Though no such exact form seems to have been produced from old Persian, we have further indications of it in the Pushtu, which Raverty writes, sing. 'a grain of rice' w'rijza'h, pl. 'rice' w'rijzey, the former close to oryza. The same writer gives in Barakai (one of the uncultivated languages of the Kabul country, spoken by a 'Tajik' tribe settled in Logar, south of Kabul, and also at Kanigoram in the Waziri country) the word for rice as w'rizza, a very close approximation again to oryza. The same word is indeed given by Leech, in an earlier vocabulary, largely coincident with the former, as rizza. The modern Persian word for husked rice is birinj, and the Armenian brinz. A nasal form, deviating further from the hypothetical br\u012bsi or vr\u012bsi, but still probably the same in origin, is found among other languages of the Hind\u016b K\u016bsh tribes, e.g. Burishki (Khajuna of Leitner) bro\u1e49; Shina (of Gilgit), br\u012b\u016b\u1e49; Khowar of the Chitral Valley (Arniyah of Leitner), grinj (Biddulph, Tribes of Hindoo Koosh, App., pp. xxxiv., lix., cxxxix.).\n 1298. -- \"Il hi a forment et ris asez, m\u00e8s il ne menuient pain de forment por ce que il est en cele provence enferme, m\u00e8s menuient ris et font poison (i.e. drink) de ris con especes qe molt e(s)t biaus et cler et fait le home evre ausi con fait le vin.\" -- Marc Pol.

The Rukh or fabulous colossal bird of Arabian legend. This has been treated of at length by one of the present writers in Marco Polo (Bk. iii. ch. 33, notes); and here we shall only mention one or two supplementary facts.\n M. Marre states that r\u016b\u1e33-r\u016b\u1e33 is applied by the Malays to a bird of prey of the vulture family, a circumstance which possibly may indicate the source of the Arabic name, as we know it to be of some at least of the legends. [See Skeat, Malay Magic, 124.]\n In one of the notes just referred to it is suggested that the roc's quills, spoken of by Marco Polo in the passage quoted below (a passage which evidently refers to some real object brought to China), might possibly have been some vegetable production such as the great frond of the Ravenala M\u00fcller and (very positively) Fabricius discard *BOUTU/ROU for *BOSMO/ROU, which \"no fellow understands. \" A. Hamilton (i. 136) mentions \"Wheat, Pulse, and Butter\" as exports from Mangaroul on this coast. He does not mention Bosmoron!\n of Madagascar (Urania speciosa), cooked to pass as a bird's quill. Mr. Sibree, in his excellent book on Madagascar (The Great African Island, 1880), noticed this, but pointed out that the object was more probably the immensely long midrib of the rofia palm (Sagus Raphia). Sir John Kirk, when in England in 1882, expressed entire confidence in this identification, and on his return to Zanzibar in 1883 sent four of these midribs to England. These must have been originally from 36 to 40 feet in length. The leaflets were all stript, but when entire the object must have strongly resembled a Brobdingnagian feather. These roc's quills were shown at the Forestry Exhibition in Edinburgh, 1884. Sir John Kirk wrote:\n \"I send to-day per S.S. Arcot . . . four fronds of the Raphia palm, called here Moale. They are just as sold and shipped up and down the coast. No doubt they were sent in Marco Polo's time in exactly the same state -- i.e. stripped of their leaflets and with the tip broken off. They are used for making stages and ladders, and last long if kept dry. They are also made into doors, by being cut into lengths, and pinned through.\"\n Some other object has recently been shown at Zanzibar as part of the wings of a great bird. Sir John Kirk writes that this (which he does not describe particularly) was in the possession of the R. C. priests at Bagamoyo, to whom it had been given by natives of the interior, and these declared that they had brought it from Tanganyika, and that it was part of the wing of a gigantic bird. On another occasion they repeated this statement, alleging that this bird was known in the Udoe (?) country, near the coast. The priests were able to communicate directly with their informants, and certainly believed the story. Dr. Hildebrand also, a competent German naturalist, believed in it. But Sir John Kirk himself says that 'what the priests had to show was most undoubtedly the whalebone of a comparatively small whale' (see letter of the present writer in Athenaeum, March 22nd, 1884).\n (c. 1000?). -- \"El Ha\u00e7an fils d'Amr et d'autres, d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'ils tenaient de maintpersonnages de l'Inde, m'ont rapport\u00e9 des choses bien extraordinaires, au sujet des oiseaux du pays de Zabedj, de Khm\u00ear (Kum\u0101r) du Senf et autres regions des parages de l'Inde.

(Par Van der Lith et Marcel Devic, pp. 62-63.)\n", "rock-pigeon": "The bird so called by sportsmen in India is the Pterocles exustus of Temminck, belonging to the family of sand-grouse (Pteroclidae). It occurs throughout India, except in the more wooded parts. In their swift high flight these birds look something like pigeons on the wing, whence perhaps the misnomer.\n", "rogue": "(Elephant), s. An elephant (generally, if not always a male) living in apparent isolation from any herd, usually a bold marauder, and a danger to travellers. Such an elephant is called in Bengal, according to Williamson, saun, i.e. s\u0101n [Hind. s\u0101n\u1e0d, Skt. sha\u1e47\u1e0da]; sometimes it would seem gun\u1e0d\u0101 [Hind. gun\u1e0d\u0101, 'a rascal']; and by the Sinhalese hora. The term rogue is used by Europeans in Ceylon, and its origin is somewhat obscure. Sir Emerson Tennent finds such an elephant called, in a curious book of the 18th century, ronkedor or runkedor, of which he supposes that rogue may perhaps have been a modification. That word looks like Port. roncador, 'a snorer, a noisy fellow, a bully,' which gives a plausible sense. But Littr\u00e9 gives rogue as a colloquial French word conveying the idea of arrogance and rudeness. In the following passage which we have copied, unfortunately without recording the source, the word comes still nearer the sense in which it is applied to the elephant: \"On commence \u00e0 s'apperceuoir d\u00e9s Bayonne, que l'humeur de ces peuples tient vn peu de celle de ses voisins, et qu'ils sont rogues et peu communicatifs avec l'Estranger.\" After all however it is most likely that the word is derived from an English use of the word. For Skeat shows that rogue, from the French sense of 'malapert, saucy, rude, surly,' came to be applied as a cant term to beggars, and is used, in some old English passages which he quotes, exactly in the sense of our modern 'tramp.' The transfer to a vagabond elephant would be easy. Mr. Skeat refers to Shakspeare:-\n \"And wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn?\" K. Lear, iv. 7.\n 1878. -- \"Much misconception exists on the subject of rogue or solitary elephants. The usually accepted belief that these elephants are turned out of the herds by their companions or rivals is not correct. Most of the so-called solitary elephants are the lords of some herds near. They leave their companions at times to roam by themselves, usually to visit cultivation or open country . . . sometimes again they make the expedition merely for the sake of solitude. They, however, keep more or less to the jungle where their herd is, and follow its movements.\" -- Sanderson, p. 52.\n", "rogue's river": "n.p. The name given by Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries to one of the Sunderbund channels joining the Lower Hoogly R. from the eastward. It was so called from being frequented by the Arakan Rovers, sometimes Portuguese vagabonds, sometimes native Muggs, whose vessels lay in this creek watching their opportunity to plunder craft going up and down the Hoogly.\n Mr. R. Barlow, who has partially annotated Hedges' Diary for the Hakluyt Society, identifies Rogue's River with Channel Creek, which is the channel between Saugor Island and the Delta. Mr. Barlow was, I believe, a member of the Bengal Pilot service, and this, therefore, must have been the application of the name in recent tradition. But I cannot reconcile this with the sailing directions in the English Pilot (1711), or the indications in Hamilton, quoted below.\n The English Pilot has a sketch chart of the river, which shows, just opposite Buffalo Point, \"R. Theeves,\" then, as we descend, the R. Rangafula, and, close below that, \"Rogues\" (without the word River), and still further below, Chanell Creek or R. Jessore. Rangafula R. and Channel Creek we still have in the charts.\n After a careful comparison of all the notices, and of the old and modern charts, I come to the conclusion that the R. of Rogues must have been either what is now called Chingr\u012b Kh\u0101l, entering immediately below Diamond Harbour, or Kalp\u012b Creek, about 6 m. further down, but the preponderance of argument is in favour of Chingr\u012b Kh\u0101l. The position of this quite corresponds with the R. Theeves of the old English chart; it corresponds in distance from Saugor (the Gunga Saugor of those days, which forms the extreme S. of what is styled Saugor Island now) with that stated by Hamilton, and also in being close to the \"first safe anchoring place in the River,\" viz. Diamond Harbour. The Rogue's River was apparently a little 'above the head of the Grand Middle Ground' or great shoals of the Hoogly, whose upper termination is now some 7\u00bd m. below Chingr\u012b Kh\u0101l. One of the extracts from the English Pilot speaks of the \"R. of Rogues, commonly called by the Country People, Adegom.\" Now there is a town on the Chingr\u012b Kh\u0101l, a few miles from its entrance into the Hoogly, which is called in Rennell's Map Ottogunge, and in the Atlas of India Sheet Huttoogum. Further, in the tracing of an old Dutch chart of the 17th century, in the India Office, I find in a position corresponding with Chingr\u012b Kh\u0101l, D'Roevers Spruit, which I take to be 'Robber's (or Rogue's) River.'\n 1683. -- \"And so we parted for this night, before which time it was resolved by ye Councill that if I should not prevail to go this way to Decca, I should attempt to do it with ye Sloopes by way of the River of Rogues, which goes through to the great River of Decca.\" -- Hedges, Diary, Hak.

Pinson, the Master Attendant, and directed him to issue out fresh orders to the Pilots not to bring up any of your Honors' Ships higher than Rogues River.'\"* -- Letter to Court, in Long, p. 32.\n", "rohilla": "n.p. A name by which Afgh\u0101ns, or more particularly Afgh\u0101ns settled in Hindustan, are sometimes known, and which gave a title to the province Rohilkand, and now, through that, to a Division of the N.W. Provinces embracing a large part of the old province. The word appears to be Pushtu, ro\u0304h\u0113lah or ro\u0304h\u0113lai, adj., formed from ro\u0304hu, 'mountain,' thus signifying 'mountaineer of Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n. ' But a large part of E. Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n specifically bore the name of Roh. Keene (Fall of the Moghul Monarchy, 41) puts the rise of the Rohillas of India in 1744, when 'Ali Mahommed revolted, and made the territory since called Rohilkhand independent. A very comprehensive application is given to the term Roh in the quotation from Firishta. A friend (Major J. M. Trotter) notes here: \"The word Rohilla is little, if at all, used now in Pushtu, but I remember a line of an ode in that language, 'S\u00e1dik Rohilai yam pa Hindub\u00e1r gad,' meaning, 'I am a simple mountaineer, compelled to live in Hindustan'; i.e. 'an honest man among knaves.'\"\n This also points to the locality of Diamond Harbour, and the Chingr\u00ef Kh\u0101l.\n c. 1452. -- \"The King . . . issued farm\u00e1ns to the chiefs of the various Afgh\u00e1n Tribes.

Garcia de Orta and Jarric deny the name of R\u016bm\u012b, as used in India, to the Turks of Asia, but they are apparently wrong in their expressions.

And probably this is the origin of the present application, in spite of the circumstance that the word is sometimes found in the form arundel. In this form the word also seems to have been employed for the conical handguard on a lance, as we learn from Bluteau's great Port.

The etymology is given by Wedgwood as from a slang word of the 16th century, rome for 'good'; rome-booze, 'good drink'; and so, rum. The English word has always with us a note of vulgarity, but we may note here that Gorresio in his Italian version of the R\u0101m\u0101yana, whilst describing the Palace of R\u0101vana, is bold enough to speak of its being pervaded by \"an odoriferous breeze, perfumed with sandalwood, and bdellium, with rum and with sirop\" (iii. 292). \"Mr. N. Darnell Davis has put forth a derivation of the word rum, which gives the only probable history of it. It came from Barbados, where the planters first distilled it, somewhere between 1640 and 1645. A MS. 'Description of Barbados,' in Trinity College, Dublin, written about 1651, says: 'The chief fudling they make in the Island is Rumbullion, alias KillDivil, and this is made of sugar-canes distilled, a hot, hellish, and terrible liquor.' G. Warren's Description of Surinam, 1661, shows the word in its present short term: 'Rum is a spirit extracted from the juice of sugar-canes . . . called Kill-Devil in New England!' 'Rambullion' is a Devonshire word, meaning 'a great tumult,' and may have been adopted from some of the Devonshire settlers in Barbados; at any rate, little doubt can exist that it has given rise to our word rum, and the longer name rumbowling, which sailors give to their grog.\"- Academy, Sept. 5, 1885.\n", "rum-johnny": "s.

Hind. r\u016bpiya, from Skt. r\u016bpya, 'wrought silver.' The standard coin of the Anglo-Indian monetary system, as it was of the Mahommedan Empire that preceded ours. It is commonly stated (as by Wilson, in his article on this word, which contains much valuable and condensed information) that the rupee was introduced by Sher Sh\u0101h (in 1542). And this is, no doubt, formally true; but it is certain that a coin substantially identical with the rupee, i.e. approximating to a standard of 100 ratis (or 175 grains troy) of silver, an ancient Hindu standard, had been struck by the Mahommedan sovereigns of Delhi in the 13th and 14th centuries, and had formed an important part of their currency. In fact, the capital coins of Delhi, from the time of Iyaltimish (A.D. 1211-1236) to the accession of Mahommed Tughlak (1325) were gold and silver pieces, respectively of the weight just mentioned. We gather from the statements of Ibn Batuta and his contemporaries that the gold coin, which the former generally calls tanga and sometimes gold d\u012bn\u0101r, was worth 10 of the silver coin, which he calls d\u012bn\u0101r, thus indicating that the relation of gold to silver value was, or had recently been, as 10:1. Mahommed Tughlak remodelled the currency, issuing gold pieces of 200 grs. and silver pieces of 140 grs. -- an indication probably of a great \"depreciation of gold\" (to use our modern language) consequent on the enormous amount of gold bullion obtained from the plunder of Western and Southern India. Some years later (1330) Mahommed developed his notable scheme of a forced currency, consisting entirely of copper tokens. This threw everything into confusion, and it was not till six years later that any sustained issues of ordinary coin were recommenced. From about this time the old standard of 175 grs. was readopted for gold, and was maintained till the time of Sher Sh\u0101h. But it does not appear that the old standard was then resumed for silver. In the reign of Mahommed's successor Feroz Sh\u0101h, Mr. E. Thomas's examples show the gold coin of 175 grs. standard running parallel with continued issues of a silver (or professedly silver) coin of 140 grs.; and this, speaking briefly, continued to be the case to the end of the Lodi dynasty (i.e. 1526). The coinage seems to have sunk into a state of great irregularity, not remedied by Baber (who struck ashraf\u012bs (see ASHRAFEE) and dirhams, such as were used in Turkestan) or Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but the reform of which was undertaken by Sher Sh\u0101h, as above mentioned.\n His silver coin of 175-178 grs. was that which popularly obtained the name of r\u016bpiya, which has continued to our day. The weight, indeed, of the coins so styled, never very accurate in native times, varied in different States, and the purity varied still more. The former never went very far on either side of 170 grs., but the quantity of pure silver contained in it sunk in some cases as low as 140 grs., and even, in exceptional cases, to 100 grs. Variation however was not confined to native States. Rupees were struck in Bombay at a very early date of the British occupation. Of these there are four specimens in the Br. Mus. The first bears obv. 'THE RVPEE OF BOMBAIM. 1677. BY AUTHORITY OF CHARLES THE SECOND; rev. KING OF GREAT BRITAINE . FRANCE . AND . IRELAND .' Wt. 167\u00b78 gr. The fourth bears obv. 'HON . SOC . ANG . IND . ORI.' with a shield; rev. 'A . DEO . PAX . ET . INCREMENTUM: -- MON . BOMBAY . ANGLIC . REGIMs. A\u02da 7\u02da.' Weight 177\u00b78 gr. Different Rupees minted by the British Government were current in the three Presidencies, and in the Bengal Presidency several were current; viz. the Sikka (see SICCA) Rupee, which latterly weighed 192 grs., and contained 176 grs. of pure silver; the Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, which latterly weighed 180 grs.,* containing 165\u00b7215 of pure silver; the Benares Rupee (up to 1819), which weighed 174\u00b776 grs., and contained 168\u00b7885 of pure silver. Besides these there was the Chal\u0101n\u012b or 'current' rupee of account, in which the Company's accounts were kept, of which 116 were equal to 100 sikkas. [\"The bhar\u012b or Company's Arcot rupee was coined at Calcutta, and was in value 3\u00bd per cent. less than the Sikka rupee\" (Beveridge, Bakarganj, 99).] The Bombay Rupee was adopted from that of Surat, and from 1800 its weight was 178\u00b732 grs.; its pure silver 164\u00b794. The Rupee at Madras (where however the standard currency was of an entirely different character, see PAGODA) was originally that of the Naw\u0101b of the Carnatic (or 'Nabob of Arcot') and was usually known as the Arcot Rupee. We find its issues varying from 171 to 177 grs. in weight, and from 160 to 170 of pure silver; whilst in 1811 there took place an abnormal coinage, from Spanish dollars, of rupees with a weight of 188 grs. and 169\u00b720 of pure silver.\n Also from some reason or other, perhaps from commerce between those places and the 'Coast,' the Chittagong and Dacca currency (i.e. in the extreme east of Bengal) \"formerly consisted of Arcot rupees; and they were for some time coined expressly for those districts at the Calcutta and The term Sonaut rupees, which was of frequent occurrence down to the reformation and unification of the Indian coinage in 1833, is one very difficult to elucidate. The word is properly sanw\u0101t, pl. of Ar. sana(t), a year. According to the old practice in Bengal, coins deteriorated in value, in comparison with the rupee of account, when they passed the third year of their currency, and these rupees were termed Sanw\u0101t or Sonaut. But in 1773, to put a stop to this inconvenience, Government determined that all rupees coined in future should bear the impression of the 19th san or year of Sh\u0101h 'Alam (the Mogul then reigning). And in all later uses of the term Sonaut it appears to be equivalent in value to the Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d rupee, or the modern \"Company's Rupee\" (which was of the same standard).\n Dacca Mints. (!) (Prinsep, Useful Tables, ed. by E. Thomas, 24.)\n These examples will give some idea of the confusion that prevailed (without any reference to the vast variety besides of native coinages), but the subject is far too complex to be dealt with minutely in the space we can afford to it in such a work as this. The first step to reform and assimilation took place under Regulation VII. of 1833, but this still maintained the exceptional Sicca in Bengal, though assimilating the rupees over the rest of India. The Sicca was abolished as a coin by Act XIII. of 1836; and the universal rupee of British territory has since been the \"Company's Rupee,\" as it was long called, of 180 grs. weight and 165 pure silver, representing therefore in fact the Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d Rupee.\n 1610. -- \"This armie consisted of 100,000 horse at the least, with infinite number of Camels and Elephants: so that with the whole baggage there could not bee lesse than fiue or sixe hundred thousand persons, insomuch that the waters were not sufficient for them; a Mussocke (see MUSSUCK) of water being sold for a Rupia, and yet not enough to be had.\" -- Hawkins, in Purchas, i. 427.\n [1615. -- \"Roupies Jangers (Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b) of 100 pisas, which goeth four for five ordinary roupies of 80 pisas called Cassanes (see KUZZANNA), and we value them at 2s. 4d. per piece: Cecaus (see SICCA) of Amadavrs which goeth for 86 pisas; Challennes of Agra, which goeth for 83 pisas.\" -- Foster, Letters, iii. 87.]\n 1616. -- \"Rupias monetae genus est, quarum singulae xxvi assibus gallicis aut circiter aequivalent.\" -- Jarric, iii. 83.\n \" \". . .

Mr. Thomas has shown that the ancient ratt\u012b may be taken as equal to 1\u00b775 grs. Troy (Numismata Orientalia, New ed., Pt. I. pp. 12-14). This work of Mr. Thomas's contains interesting information regarding the old Indian custom of basing standard weights upon the weight of seeds, and we borrow from his paper the following extract from Manu (viii. 132): \"The very small mote which may be discerned in a sunbeam passing through a lattice is the first of quantities, and men call it a trasare\u1e47u. 133. Eight of these trasare\u1e47us are supposed equal in weight to one minute poppy-seed (likhy\u00e1), three of those seeds are equal to one black mustard - seed (raja - sarshapa), and three of these last to a white mustard-seed (gaurasarshapa). 134, Six white mustardseeds are equal to a middle-sized barley-corn (yava), three such barleycorns to one krish\u1e47ala (or raktika), five krish\u1e47alas of gold are one m\u00e1sha, and sixteen such m\u00e1shas one suvarna,\" &c. (ibid. p. 13). In the \u0100\u012bn, Abul Fazl calls the ratti surkh, which is a translation (Pers. for 'red'). In Persia the seed is called chashm-i-khur\u016bs, 'Cock's eye' (see Blochmann's E.T., i. 16 n., and Jarrett, ii. 354). Further notices of the rat\u012b used as a weight for precious stones will be found in Sir W. Elliot's Coins of Madras (p. 49). Sir Walter's experience is that the rat\u012b of the gem-dealers is a double rat\u012b, and an approximation to the ma\u1e47j\u0101\u1e0di (see MANGELIN).
