{"sabaio": "&c., n.p. The name generally given by the Portuguese writers to the Mahommedan prince who was in possession of Goa when they arrived in India, and who had lived much there. He was in fact that one of the captains of the B\u0101hman\u012b kingdom of the Deccan who, in the division that took place on the decay of the dynasty towards the end of the 15th century, became the founder of the 'Adil Sh\u0101h\u012b family which reigned in Bijapur from 1489 to the end of the following century (see IDALCAN). His real name was Abdul Muzaffar Y\u016bsuf, with the surname Sab\u0101\u012b or Sav\u0101\u012b. There does not seem any ground for rejecting the intelligent statement of De Barros (II. v. 2) that he had this name from being a native of S\u0101v\u0101 in Persia [see Bombay Gazetteer, xxiii. 404]. Garcia de Orta does not seem to have been aware of this history, and he derives the name from S\u0101\u1e25ib (see below), apparently a mere guess, though not an unnatural one. Mr. Birch's surmise (Alboquerque, ii. 82), with these two old and obvious sources of suggestion before him, that \"the word may possibly be connected with sip\u0101h\u012b, Arabic, a soldier,\" is quite inadmissible (nor is sip\u0101h\u012b Arabic). [On this word Mr. Whiteway writes: \"In his explanation of this word Sir H. Yule has been misled by Barros. Couto (Dec. iv. Bk. 10 ch. 4) is conclusive, where he says: 'This \u00c7ufo extended the limits of his rule as far as he could till he went in person to conquer the island of Goa, which was a valuable possession for its income, and was in possession of a lord of Canara, called Savay, a vassal of the King of Canara, who then had his headquarters at what we call Old Goa. . . . As there was much jungle here, Savay, the lord of Goa, had certain houses where he stayed for hunting. . . . These houses still preserve the memory of the Hindu Savay, as they are called the Savayo's house, where for many years the Governors of India lived. As our Joa\u0303o de Barros could not get true information of these things, he confounded the name of the Hindu Savay with that of \u00c7ufo (? Y\u016bsuf) Adil Sh\u0101h, saying in the 5th Book of his 2nd Decade that when we went to India a Moor called Soay was lord of Goa, that we ordinarily called him Sabayo, and that he was a vassal of the King of the Deccan, a Persian, and native of the city of Sawa. At this his sons laughed heartily when we read it to them, saying that their father was anything but a Turk, and his name anything but \u00c7ufo.' This passage makes it clear that the origin of the word is the Hindu title Siw\u0101\u012b, Hind. Saw\u0101\u012b, 'having the excess of a fourth,' 'a quarter better than other people,' which is one of the titles of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Jaypur. To show that it was more or less well known, I may point to the little State of Sunda, which lay close to Goa on the S.E., of which the R\u0101ja was of the Vijayanagar family. This little State became independent after the destruction of Vijayanagar, and remained in existence till absorbed by Tippoo Sultan. In this State Siw\u0101\u012b was a common honorific of the ruling family. At the same time Barros was not alone in calling Adil Sh\u0101h the Sabaio (see Alboquerque, Cartas, p. 24), where the name occurs. The mistake having been made, everyone accepted it.\"]\n There is a story, related as unquestionable by Firishta, that the Sabaio was in reality a son of the Turkish Sultan Ag\u0101 Mur\u0101d (or 'Amurath') II., who was saved from murder at his father's death, and placed in the hands of 'Im\u0101d-ud-d\u012bn, a Persian merchant of S\u0101v\u0101, by whom he was brought up. In his youth he sought his fortune in India, and being sold as a slave, and going through a succession of adventures, reached his high position in the Deccan (Briggs, Firishta, iii. 7-8).\n 1510. -- \"But when Afonso Dalboquerque took Goa, it would be about 40 years more or less since the \u00c7abaio had taken it from the Hindoos.\" -- Dalboquerque, ii. 96.\n \" \"In this island (Goa called Goga) there is a fortress near the sea, walled round after our manner, in which there is sometimes a captain called Savaiu, who has 400 Mamelukes, he himself being also a Mameluke. . . .\" -- Varthema, 116.\n 1516. -- \"Going further along the coast there is a very beautiful river, which sends two arms into the sea, making between them an island, on which stands the city of Goa belonging to Daquem (Deccan), and it was a principality of itself with other districts adjoining in the interior; and in it there was a great Lord, as vassal of the said King (of Deccan) called Sabayo, who being a good soldier, well mannered and experienced in war, this lordship of Goa was bestowed upon him, that he might continually make war on the King of Narsinga, as he did until his death. And then he left this city to his son \u00c7abaym Hydal\u00e7an. . . .\" -- Barros, Lisbon ed. 287.\n 1563. -- \"O.. . . And returning to our subject, as Adel in Persian means 'justice,' they called the prince of these territories Adelham, as it were 'Lord of Justice.'\n \"R. A name highly inappropriate, for neither he nor the rest of them are wont to do justice. But tell me also why in Spain they call him the Sabaio?\n \"O. Some have told me that he was so called because they used to call a Captain by this name; but I afterwards came to know that in fact saibo in Arabic means 'lord.' . . .\" -- Garcia, f. 36.\n", "sable-fish": "See HILSA. \n", "sadras": "n.p. This name of a place 42 m. south of Madras, the seat of an old Dutch factory, was probably shaped into the usual form in a sort of conformity with Madras or Madraspatam. The correct name is Sadurai, but it is sometimes made into Sadrang- and Shatranj-patam. [The Madras Gloss. gives Tam. Shathurangappatanam, Skt. chatur-anga, 'the four military arms, infantry, cavalry, elephants and cars.'] Fryer (p. 28) calls it Sandraslapatam, which is probably a misprint for Sandrastapatam.\n 1672. -- \"From Tirepoplier you come . . . to Sadraspatam, where our people have a Factory.\" -- Baldaeus, 152.\n 1726. -- \"The name of the place is properly Sadrangapatam; but for short it is also called Sadrampatam, and most commonly Sadraspatam. In the Tellinga it indicates the name of the founder, and in Persian it means 'thousand troubles' or the Shahboard which we call chess.\" -- Valentijn, Choromandel, 11. The curious explanation of Shatranj or 'chess,' as 'a thousand troubles,' is no doubt some popular etymology; such as P. sad-ranj, 'a hundred griefs.' The word is really of Sanskrit origin, from Chaturangam, literally, 'quadripartite'; the four constituent parts of an army, viz. horse, foot, chariots and elephants.\n [1727. -- \"Saderass, or Saderass Patam.\" (See under LONG-CLOTH.)]\n c. 1780. -- \"J'avois pens\u00e9 que Sadras auroit \u00e9t\u00e9 le lieu o\u00f9 devoient finir mes contrariet\u00e9s et mes courses.\" -- Haafner, i. 141.\n \" \"'Non, je ne suis point Anglois,' m'\u00e9criai-je avec indignation et transport; 'je suis un Hollandois de Sadringapatnam.'\" -- Ibid. 191.\n 1781. -- \"The chief officer of the French now despatched a summons to the English commandant of the Fort to surrender, and the commandant, not being of opinion he could resist . . . evacuated the fort, and proceeded by sea in boats to Sudrung Puttun.\" -- H. of Hydur Naik, 447.\n", "safflower": "s. The flowers of the annual Carthamus tinctorius, L. (N.O. Compositae), a considerable article of export from India for use of a red dye, and sometimes, from the resemblance of the dried flowers to saffron, termed 'bastard saffron.' The colouring matter of safflower is the basis of rouge. The name is a curious modification of words by the 'striving after meaning.' For it points, in the first half of the name, to the analogy with saffron, and in the second half, to the object of trade being a flower. But neither one nor the other of these meanings forms any real element in the word. Safflower appears to be an eventual corruption of the Arabic name of the thing, 'us\u0324f\u016br. This word we find in medieval trade-lists (e.g. in Pegolotti) to take various forms such as asfiore, asfrole, astifore, zaffrole, saffiore; from the last of which the transition to safflower is natural. In the old Latin translation of Avicenna it seems to be called Crocus hortulanus, for the corresponding Arabic is given hasfor. Another Arabic name for this article is \u1e33ur\u1e6dum, which we presume to be the origin of the botanist's carthamus. In Hind. it is called kusumbha or kusum. Bretschneider remarks that though the two plants, saffron and safflower, have not the slightest resemblance, and belong to two different families and classes of the nat. system, there has been a certain confusion between them among almost all nations, including the Chinese.\n c. 1200. -- \"'Usfur . . .

Arab. za'far\u0101n. The true saffron (Crocus sativus, L.) in India is cultivated in Kashm\u012br only. In South India this name is given to turmeric, which the Portuguese called a\u00e7afra\u0303o da terra ('country saffron.') The Hind. name is hald\u012b, or in the Deccan halad, [Skt. haridra, hari, 'green, yellow']. Garcia de Orta calls it croco Indiaco, 'Indian saffron.' Indeed, Dozy shows that the Arab. kurkum for turmeric (whence the bot: Lat. curcuma) is probably taken from the Greek KRO/KOS or obl. KRO/KON. Moodeen Sherif says that kurkum is applied to saffron in many Persian and other writers.\n c. 1200. -- \"The Persians call this root alHard, and the inhabitants of Basra call it al - Kurkum, and al - Kurkum is Saffron. They call these plants Saffron because they dye yellow in the same way as Saffron does.\" -- Ibn Baithar, ii. 370.\n 1563. -- \"R. Since there is nothing else to be said on this subject, let us speak of what we call 'country saffron.'\n \"O.

In this city (Goa) there is little of it, but much in Malabar, i.e. in Cananor and Calecut. The Canarins call the root alad; and the Malabars sometimes give it the same name, but more properly call it mangale, and the Malays cunhet; the Persians, darzard, which is as much as to say 'yellow - wood.' The Arabs call it habet; and all of them, each in turn, say that this saffron does not exist in Persia, nor in Arabia, nor in Turkey, except what comes from India.\" -- Garcia, f. 78v. Further on he identifies it with curcuma.\n 1726. -- \"Curcuma, or Indian Saffron.\" -- Valentijn, Chor. 42.\n", "sagar-pesha": "s. Camp-followers, or the body of servants in a private establishment.

Rumphii, Willd., found in every part of the Indian Archipelago, including the Philippines, wherever there is proper soil. They are most abundant in the eastern part of the region indicated, including the Moluccas and N. Guinea, which probably formed the original habitat; and in these they supply the sole bread of the natives. In the remaining parts of the Archipelago, sago is the food only of certain wild tribes, or consumed (as in Mindanao) by the poor only, or prepared (as at Singapore, &c.) for export. There are supposed to be five species producing the article.\n 1298. -- \"They have a kind of trees that produce flour, and excellent flour it is for food.

They make provision of this bread for their sea voyages.\" -- Pigafetta, Hak. Soc. p. 136.

A name applied often in books, and, formerly at least, in the colloquial use of European settlers and traders, to the Gomuti palm or Arenga saccharifera, Labill., which abounds in the Ind. Archipelago, and is of great importance in its rural economy. The name is Port. sagueira (analogous to palmeira), in Span. of the Indies saguran, and no doubt is taken from sagu, as the tree, though not the Sago-palm of commerce, affords a sago of inferior kind. Its most important product, however, is the sap, which is used as toddy (q.v.), and which in former days also afforded almost all the sugar used by natives in the islands. An excellent cordage is made from a substance resembling black horse-hair, which is found between the trunk and the fronds, and this is the gomuti of the Malays, which furnished one of the old specific names (Borassus Gomutus, Loureiro). There is also found in a like position a fine cotton-like substance which makes excellent tinder, and strong stiff spines from which pens are made, as well as arrows for the blow-pipe, or Sumpitan (see SARBATANE). \"The seeds have been made into a confection, whilst their pulpy envelope abounds in a poisonous juice -- used in the barbarian wars of the natives -- to which the Dutch gave the appropriate name of 'hell-water'\" (Crawfurd, Desc.

This name is applied to the tubers of various species of orchis found in Europe and Asia, which from ancient times have had a great reputation as being restorative and highly nutritious. This reputation seems originally to have rested on the 'doctrine of signatures,' but was due partly no doubt to the fact that the mucilage of saleb has the property of forming, even with the addition of 40 parts of water, a thick jelly. Good modern authorities quite disbelieve in the virtues ascribed to saleb, though a decoction of it, spiced and sweetened, makes an agreeable drink for invalids. Saleb is identified correctly by Ibn Baithar with the Satyrium of Dioscorides and Galen. The full name in Ar. (analogous to the Greek orchis) is Khu\u1e63\u012bal-tha'lab, i.e. 'testiculus vulpis'; but it is commonly known in India as s\u0324a'lab mi\u1e63r\u012b, i.e. Salep of Egypt, or popularly salep-misry. In Upper India s\u0324aleb is derived from various species of Eulophia, found in Kashm\u012br and the Lower Him\u0101laya. Saloop, which is, or used to be, supplied hot in winter mornings by itinerant vendors in the streets of London, is, we believe, a representative of Saleb; but we do not know from what it is prepared. [In 1889 a correspondent to Notes & Queries (7 ser. vii. 35) stated that \"within the last twenty years saloop vendors might have been seen plying their trade in the streets of London. The term saloop was also applied to an infusion of the sassafras bark or wood. In Pereira's Materia Medica, published in 1850, it is stated that 'sassafras tea, flavoured with milk and sugar, is sold at daybreak in the streets of London under the name of saloop.'

Counsel on both sides suggested that the thing should be brought into court. Mr. Justice Norris hesitated to give this order till he had taken advice. The attorneys on both sides, Hindus, said there could be no objection; the Court interpreter, a highcaste Brahman, said it could not be brought into Court, because of thecoirmatting, but it might with perfect propriety be brought into the corridor for inspection; which was done. This took place during the excitement about the \"Ilbert Bill,\" giving natives magisterial authority in the provinces over Europeans; and there followed most violent and offensive articles in several native newspapers reviling Mr. Justice Norris, who was believed to be hostile to the Bill. The editor of the Bengallee newspaper, an educated man, and formerly a member of the covenanted Civil Service, the author of one of the most unscrupulous and violent articles, was summoned for contempt of court.

The island of Bombay is indeed naturally a kind of pendant to the island of Salsette, and during the Portuguese occupation it was so in every sense. That occupation is still marked by the remains of numerous villas and churches, and by the survival of a large R. Catholic population. The island also contains the famous and extensive caves of K\u0101nh\u0113r\u012b (see KENNERY). The old city of Tana (q.v.) also stands upon Salsette. Salsette was claimed as part of the Bombay dotation of Queen Catherine, but refused by the Portuguese. The Mahrattas took it from them in 1739, and it was taken from these by us in 1774. The name has been by some connected with the saltworks which exist upon the islands (Salinas). But it appears in fact to be the corruption of a Mahratti name Sh\u0101sh\u1e6d\u012b, from Sh\u0101shash\u1e6d\u012b, meaning 'Sixty-six' (Skt. Sha\u1e6d-shash\u1e6di), because (it is supposed) the island was alleged to contain that number of villages. This name occurs in the form Shatsashti in a stone inscription dated Sak. 1103 (A.D. 1182). See Bo. J. R. As. Soc. xii. 334. Another inscription on copper plates dated Sak. 748 (A.D. 1027) contains a grant of the village of Naura, \"one of the 66 of \u015ari Sth\u0101naka (Thana),\" thus entirely confirming the etymology (J.R. As. Soc. ii. 383). I have to thank Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.S.I., for drawing my attention to these inscriptions.\n b.

From Low Latin santalum, in Greek SA/NTALON, and in later Greek SA/NDANON; coming from the Arab. sandal, and that from Skt. chandana. The name properly belongs to the fragrant wood of the Santalum album, L. Three woods bearing the name santalum, white, yellow, and red, were in officinal use in the Middle Ages. But the name Red Sandalwood, or Red Sanders, has been long applied, both in English and in the Indian vernaculars, to the wood of Pterocarpus santalina, L., a tree of S. India, the wood of which is inodorous, but which is valued for various purposes in India (pillars, turning, &c.), and is exported as a dyewood. According to Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger this last was the sanders so much used in the cookery of the Middle Ages for colouring sauces, &c. In the opinion of those authorities it is doubtful whether the red sandal of the medieval pharmacologists was a kind of the real odorous sandal-wood, or was the wood of Pteroc. santal. It is possible that sometimes the one and sometimes the other was meant. For on the one hand, even in modern times, we find Milburn (see below) speaking of the three colours of the real sandal-wood; and on the other hand we find Matthioli in the 16th century speaking of the red sandal as inodorous.\n It has been a question how the Pterocarpus santalina came to be called sandal-wood at all. We may suggest, as a possible origin of this, the fact that its powder \"mixed with oil is used for bathing and purifying the skin\" (Drury, s.v.), much as the true sandal-wood powder also is used in the East.\n c. 545. -- \"And from the remoter regions, I speak of Tzinista and other places of export, the imports to Taprobane are silk, aloeswood, cloves, Sandalwood (TZA/NDANH), and so forth. . . .\" -- Cosmas, in Cathay, &c., clxxvii.\n 1298. -- \"Encore sachiez que en ceste ysle a arbres de sandal vermoille ausi grant come sunt les arbres des nostre contr\u00e9e . . . et il en ont bois come nos avuns d'autres arbres sauvajes.\" -- Marco Polo, Geog.

This is a term (pl. sanguiceis) often used by the Portuguese writers on India for a kind of boat, or small vessel, used in war. We are not able to trace any origin in a vernacular word.

This was obviously at first only an epithet, and it is not of very ancient use in this specific application. To the Brahmans Sanskrit was the bh\u0101sha, or language, and had no particular name. The word Sanskrit is used by the protogrammarian P\u0101nini (some centuries before Christ), but not as a denomination of the language. In the latter sense, however, both 'Sanskrit' and 'Prakrit' (Pracrit) are used in the Brihat Samhit\u0101 of Var\u0101hamihira, c. A.D. 504, in a chapter on omens (lxxxvi. 3), to which Prof. Kern's translation does not extend. It occurs also in the Mrichch'hakatik\u0101, translated by Prof. H. H. Wilson in his Hindu Theatre, under the name of the 'Toy-cart'; in the works of Kum\u0101rila Bhatta, a writer of the 7th century; and in the P\u0101\u1e47nin\u012by\u0101 \u015a\u012bksh\u0101, a metrical treatise ascribed by the Hindus to P\u0101\u1e47ini, but really of comparatively modern origin.\n There is a curiously early mention of Sanskrit by the Mahommedan poet Am\u012br Khusr\u016b of Delhi, which is quoted below. The first mention (to our knowledge) of the word in any European writing is in an Italian letter of Sassetti's, addressed from Malabar to Bernardo Davanzati in Florence, and dating from 1586. The few words on the subject, of this writer, show much acumen.\n In the 17th and 18th centuries such references to this language as occur are found chiefly in the works of travellers to Southern India, and by these it is often called Grandonic, or the like, from grantha, 'a book' (see GRUNTH, GRUNTHUM) i.e. a book of the classical Indian literature. The term Sanskrit came into familiar use after the investigations into this language by the English in Bengal (viz. by Wilkins, Jones, &c.) in the last quarter of the 18th century.

We cannot learn much about this coin of Tonquin.

Baber: \"Very probably from Malay sa, 'one,' and p\u0103ku, 'a string or file of the small coin called pichis.' Pichis is explained by Crawfurd as 'Small coin . . . money of copper, brass, or tin. . . . It was the ancient coin of Java, and also the only one of the Malays when first seen by the Portuguese.' P\u0103ku is written by Favre pe\u1e33\u016b (Dict. Malais-Fran\u00e7ais) and is derived by him from Chinese p\u00e9-ko, 'cent.' In the dialect of Canton pak is the word for 'a hundred,' and one pak is the colloquial term for a string of one hundred cash.\" Sapeku would then be properly a string of 100 cash, but it is not difficult to conceive that it might through some misunderstanding (e.g. a confusion of peku and pichis) have been transferred to the single coin. There is a passage in Mr. Gerson da Cunha's Contributions to the Study of Portuguese Numismatics, which may seem at first sight inconsistent with this derivation. For he seems to imply that the smallest denomination of coin struck by Albuquerque at Goa in 1510 was called cepayqua, i.e. in the year before the capture of Malacca, and consequent familiarity with Malay terms. I do not trace his authority for this; the word is not mentioned in the Commentaries of Alboquerque, and it is quite possible that the dinheiros, as these small copper coins were also called, only received the name cepayqua at a later date, and some time after the occupation of Malacca (see Da Cunha, pp. 11-12, and 22). [But also see the quotation of 1510 from Correa under PARDAO. This word has been discussed by Col. Temple (Ind. Antiq., August 1897, pp. 222 seq.), who gives quotations establishing the derivation from the Malay sapaku.\n [1639. -- \"It (caxa, cash) hath a four-square hole through it, at which they string them on a Straw; a String of two hundred Caxaes, called Sata, is worth about three farthings sterling, and five Satas tyed together make a Sapocon. The Javians, when this money first came amongst them, were so cheated with the Novelty, that they would give six bags of Pepper for ten Sapocons, thirteen whereof amount to but a Crown.\" -- Mandelslo, Voyages, E.T. p. 117.\n [1703. -- \"This is the reason why the Caxas are valued so little: they are punched in the middle, and string'd with little twists of Straw, two hundred in one Twist, which is called Santa, and is worth nine Deniers.

Sapocon).\" -- Collection of Dutch Voyages, 199.\n [1830. -- \"The money current in Bali consists solely of Chinese pice with a hole in the centre. . . .

The wood of Caesalpina sappan; the ba\u1e33\u1e33am of the Arabs, and the Brazil-wood of medieval commerce. Bishop Caldwell at one time thought the Tamil name, from which this was taken, to have been given because the wood was supposed to come from Japan. Rumphius says that Siam and Champa are the original countries of the Sappan, and quotes from Rheede that in Malabar it was called Tsajampangan, suggestive apparently of a possible derivation from Champa. The mere fact that it does not come from Japan would not disprove this derivation any more than the fact that turkeys and maize did not originally come from Turkey would disprove the fact of the birds and the grain (gran turco) having got names from such a belief. But the tree appears to be indigenous in Malabar, the Deccan, and the Malay Peninsula; whilst the Malay\u0101l. shappa\u1e45\u1e45am, and the Tamil shappu, both signifying 'red (wood),' are apparently derivatives from shawa, 'to be red,' and suggest another origin as most probable. [The Mad. Gloss. gives Mal. chappannam, from chappu, 'leaf,' Skt. anga, 'body'; Tam. shappangam.] The Malay word is also sapang, which Crawfurd supposes to have originated the tradename. If, however, the etymology just suggested be correct, the word must have passed from Continental India to the Archipelago.

This is not Anglo-Indian, but it often occurs in French works on the East, as applied to the blowing-tubes used by various tribes of the Indian Islands for discharging small arrows, often poisoned. The same instrument is used among the tribes of northern South America, and in some parts of Madagascar. The word comes through the Span. cebratana, cerbatana,zarbatana, also Port. sarabatana, &c., Ital. cerbotana, Mod. Greek ZAROBOTA/NA, from the Ar. zaba\u1e6d\u0101na, 'a tube for blowing pellets' (a pea-shooter in fact!). Dozy says that the r must have been sounded in the Arabic of the Spanish Moors, as Pedro de Alcala translates zebratana by Ar. zarbat\u0101na. The resemblance of this to the Malay sumpitan (q.v.) is curious, though it is not easy to suggest a transition, if the Arabic word is, as it appears, old enough to have been introduced into Spanish. There is apparently, however, no doubt that in Arabic it is a borrowed word. The Malay word seems to be formed directly from sumpit, 'to discharge from the mouth by a forcible expiration' (Crawfurd, Mal.

Caldwell's H. of Tinnevelly, p. 103 and passim; [Stuart, Man. ofTinnevelly, 50. This explanation is probably incorrect. Welsh (Military Rem. i. 104) defines sarabogies as \"a species of park guns, for firing salutes at feasts, &c.; but not used in war.\" It has been suggested that the word is simply Hind. sirbojha, 'a head-load,' and Dr. Grierson writes: \"'Laden with a head' may refer to a head carried home on a spear.\" Dr. Pope writes: \"Sarboji is not found in any Dravidian dialect, as far as I know. It is a synonym for Sivaji. Sarva (sarbo)-ji is honorific. In the Tanjore Inscription it is Serfogi.

A name often given to Siam in the early part of the 16th century; from Shahr-inao, Pers. 'New-city'; the name by which Yuthia or Ayodhya (see JUDEA), the capital founded on the Menam about 1350, seems to have become known to the traders of the Persian Gulf. Mr. Braddell (J. Ind. Arch. v. 317) has suggested that the name (Sheher-al-nawi, as he calls it) refers to the distinction spoken of by La Loub\u00e8re between the Thai-Yai, an older people of the race, and the Thai-Noi, the people known to us as Siamese. But this is less probable. We have still a city of Siam called Lophabur\u012b, anciently a capital, and the name of which appears to be a Sanskrit or Pali form, Nava-pura, meaning the same as Shahr-i-nao; and this indeed may have first given rise to the latter name. The Cernove of Nicolo Conti (c. 1430) is generally supposed to refer to a city of Bengal, and one of the present writers has identified it with Lakhn\u0101ot\u012b or Gau\u1e5b, an official name of which in the 14th cent. was Shahr-i-nao.

The same article of dress, and the name (saran) are used in Ceylon. It is an old Indian form of dress, but is now used only by some of the people of the south; e.g. on the coast of Malabar, where it is worn by the Hindus (white), by the Mappilas (Moplah) of that coast, and the Labbais (Lubbye) of Coromandel (coloured), and by the Ban\u1e6dts of Canara, who wear it of a dark blue. With the Labbais the coloured sarong is a modern adoption from the Malays. Crawfurd seems to explain sarung as Javanese, meaning first 'a case or sheath,' and then a wrapper or garment.

The common derivation [accepted by Prof. Skeat (Concise Dict. 2nd ed. s.v.] is with Low Lat. seta, 'silk,' Lat. seta, saeta, 'a bristle, a hair,' through the Port. setim. Dr. Wells Williams (Mid.

It is true that sz't\u00fcn or sz'-twan is a common (and ancient) term for this sort of silk texture. But we may remark that trade-words adopted directly from the Chinese are comparatively rare (though no doubt the intermediate transit indicated would meet this objection, more or less). And we can hardly doubt that the true derivation is that given in Cathay and the Way Thither, p. 486; viz. from Zaitun or Zayton, the name by which Chwan-chau (Chinchew), the great medieval port of western trade in Fokien, was known to western traders.

Waterfield, of the India Office, one of the busiest men in the public service, but, as so often happens, one of the readiest to render assistance) the obscurity attaching to the word sayer in this sense was especially great.\n Wilson, s.v. says: \"In its original purport the word signifies moving, walking, or the whole, the remainder; from the latter it came to denote the remaining, or all other, sources of revenue accruing to the Government in addition to the land-tax.\" In fact, according to this explanation, the application of the term might be illustrated by the ancient story of a German Professor lecturing on botany in the pre-scientific period. He is reported to have said: 'Every plant, gentlemen, is divided into two parts. This is the root, -- and this is the rest of it!' Land revenue was the root, and all else was 'the rest of it.'\n Sir C. Trevelyan again, in a passage quoted below, says that the Arabic word has \"the same meaning as 'miscellaneous.'\" Neither of these explanations, we conceive, pace tantorum virorum, is correct.\n The term Sayer in the 18th century was applied to a variety of inland imposts, but especially to local and arbitrary charges levied by zemindars and other individuals, with a show of authority, on all goods passing through their estates by land or water, or sold at markets (bazar, haut, gunge) established by them, charges which formed in the aggregate an enormous burden upon the trade of the country.\n Now the fact is that in s\u0101'ir two old Semitic forms have coalesced in sound though coming from different roots, viz. (in Arabic) sair, producing s\u0101'ir, 'walking, current,' and s\u0101'r, producing s\u0101'ir, 'remainder,' the latter being a form of the same word that we have in the Biblical Shear-jashub, 'the remnant shall remain' (Isaiah, vii. 3). And we conceive that the true sense of the Indian term was 'current or customary charges'; an idea that lies at the root of sundry terms of the same kind in various languages, including our own Customs, as well as the dustoory which is so familiar in India. This interpretation is aptly illustrated by the quotation below from Mr. Stuart's Minute of Feb. 10, 1790.\n At a later period it seems probable that some confusion arose with the other sense of s\u0101'ir, leading to its use, more or less, for 'et ceteras,' and accounting for what we have indicated above as erroneous explanations of the word.\n I find, however, that the Index and Glossary to the Regulations, ed. 1832 (vol. iii.), defines: \"Sayer. What moves. Variable imports, distinct from land-rent or revenue, consisting of customs, tolls, licenses, duties on merchandise, and other articles of personal moveable property; as well as mixed duties, and taxes on houses shops, bazars, &c.\" This of course throws some doubt on the rationale of the Arabic name as suggested above.\n In a despatch of April 10, 1771, to Bengal, the Court of Directors drew attention to the private Bazar charges, as \"a great detriment to the public collections, and a burthen and oppression to the inhabitants\"; enjoining that no Buzars or Gunges should be kept up but such as particularly belonged to the Government. And in such the duties were to be rated in such manner as the respective positions and prosperity of the different districts would admit.\n In consequence of these instructions it was ordered in 1773 that \"all duties coming under the description of sayer Chelluntah (H. chalant\u0101, 'in transit'), and Rah-darry (radaree) . . . and other oppressive impositions on the foreign as well as the internal trade of the country\" should be abolished; and, to prevent all pretext of injustice, proportional deductions of rent were conceded to the zemindars in the annual collections. Nevertheless the exactions went on much as before, in defiance of this and repeated orders. And in 1786 the Board of Revenue issued a proclamation declaring that any person levying such duties should be subject to corporal punishment, and that the zemindar in whose zemindarry such an offence might be committed, should forfeit his lands.\n Still the evil practices went on till 1790, when Lord Cornwallis took up the matter with intelligence and determination. In the preceding year he had abolished all radaree duties in Behar and Benares, but the abuses in Bengal Proper seem to have been more swarming and persistent. On June 11, 1790, orders were issued resuming the collection of all duties indicated into the hands of Government; but this was followed after a few weeks (July 28) by an order abolishing them altogether, with some exceptions, which will be presently alluded to. This double step is explained by the Governor-General in a Minute dated July 18: \"When I first proposed the resumption of the Sayer from the Landholders, it appeared to me advisable to continue the former collection (the unauthorised articles excepted) for the current year, in order that by the necessary accounts [we might have the means] for making a fair adjustment of the compensation, and at the same time acquire sufficient knowledge of the collections to enable us to enter upon the regulation of them from the commencement of the ensuing year. . . . The collections appear to be so numerous, and of so intricate a nature, as to preclude the possibility of regulating them all; and as the establishment of new rates for such articles as it might be thought advisable to continue would require much consideration, . . . I recommend that, instead of continuing the collection . . . for the current year . . . all the existing articles of Sayer collection (with the exception of the Abkarry (Abcarree) . . .) be immediately abolished; and that the Collectors be directed to withdraw their officers from the Gunges, Bazars and Hauts,\" compensation being duly made. The Board of Revenue could then consider on what few articles of luxury in general consumption it might be proper to reimpose a tax.\n The Order of July 28 abolished \"all duties, taxes, and collections coming under the denomination of Sayer (with the exception of the Government and Calcutta Customs, the duties levied on pilgrims at Gya, and other places of pilgrimage, -- the Abkarry . . . which is to be collected on account of the Government . . . the collections made in the Gunges, Bazars and Hauts situated within the limits of Calcutta, and such collections as are confirmed to the landholders and the holders of Gunges &c. by the published Resolutions of June 11, 1790, namely, rent paid for the use of land (and the like) . . . or for orchards, pasture-ground, or fisheries sometimes included in the sayer under the denomination of phulkur (Hind. phalkar, from phal, 'fruit'), bunkur (from Hind. ban, 'forest or pasture-ground'), and julkur (Hind. jalkar, from jal, 'water') . . . .\" These Resolutions are printed with Regn. XXVII. of 1793.\n By an order of the Board of Revenue of April 28, 1790, correspondence regarding Sayer was separated from 'Land Revenue'; and on the 16th idem the Abkarry was separately regulated. \n The amount in the Accounts credited as Land Revenue in Bengal seems to have included both Sayer and Abkarry down to the Accts. presented to Parliament in 1796. In the \"Abstract Statement of Receipts and Disbursements of the Bengal Government\" for 1793-94, the \"Collections under head of Syer and Abkarry\" amount to Rs. 10,98,256. In the Accounts, printed in 1799, for 1794-5 to 1796-7, the \"Land and Sayer Revenues\" are given, but Abk\u0101r\u012b is not mentioned. Among the Receipts and Disbursements for 1800-1 appears \"Syer Collections, including Abkaree, 7,81,925.\"\n These forms appear to have remained in force down to 1833. In the accounts presented in 1834, from 1828-9, to 1831-2, with Estimate for 1832-3, Land Revenue is given separately, and next to it Syer and Abkaree Revenue. Except that the spelling was altered back to Sayer and Abkarry, this remained till 1856. In 1857 the accounts for 1854-5 showed in separate lines,-\n Land Revenue, Excise Duties, in Calcutta, Sayer Revenue, Abkarrv ditto.\n In the accounts for 1861-2 it became-\n Land Revenue, Sayer and Miscellaneous, Abkaree,\n and in those for 1863-4 Sayer vanished altogether.\n The term Sayer has been in use in Madras and Bombay as well as in Bengal. From the former we give an example under 1802; from the latter we have not met with a suitable quotation.\n The following entries in the Bengal accounts for 1858-59 will exemplify the application of Sayer in the more recent times of its maintenance:- Under Bengal, Behar and Orissa: Sale of Trees and Sunken Boats . . . . .

John Butt, Scavenger and Cornmeeter, Tevenapatam, Mercht.\"\n Under 1714 we find again, at Fort St. George:\n \"Joseph Smart, Rentall General and Scavenger, 8th of Council,\"\n and so on, in the entries of most years down to 1761, when we have, for the last time:\n \"Samuel Ardley, 7th of Council, Masulipatam, Land - Customer, Military Storekeeper, Rentall General, and Scavenger.\"\n Some light is thrown upon this surprising occurrence of such a term by a reference to Cowel's Law Dictionary, or The Interpreter (published originally in 1607) new ed. of 1727, where we read:\n \"Scavage, Scavagium. It is otherwise called Schevage, Shewage, and Scheauwing; maybe deduced from the Saxon Seawian (Sceawian?) Ostendere, and is a kind of Toll or Custom exacted by Mayors, Sheriffs, &c., of Merchant-strangers, for Wares shewed or offered to Sale within their Precincts, which is prohibited by the Statute 19 H. 7, 8. In a Charter of Henry the Second to the City of Canterbury it is written Scewinga, and (in Mon. Ang. 2, per fol. 890 b.) Sceawing; and elsewhere I find it in Latin Tributum Ostensorium. The City of London still retains the Custom, of which in An old printed Book of the Customs of London, we read thus, Of which Custom halfen del appertaineth to the Sheriffs, and the other halfen del to the Hostys in whose Houses the Merchants been lodged; And it is to wet that Scavage is the Shew by cause that Merchanties (sic) shewn unto the Sheriffs. Merchandizes, of the which Customs ought to be taken ere that ony thing thereof be sold, &c.\n \"Scavenger, From the Belgick Scavan, to scrape. Two of every Parish within London and the suburbs are yearly chosen into this Office, who hire men called Rakers, and carts, to cleanse the streets, and carry away the Dirt and Filth thereof, mentioned in 14 Car. 2, cap. 2. The Germans call him a Drecksimon, from one Simon, a noted Scavenger of Marpurg.\n * * * * * \"Schavaldus, The officer who collected the Scavage-Money, which was sometimes done with Extortion and great Oppression.\" (Then quotes Hist. of Durham from Wharton, Anglia Sacra, Pt. i. p. 75; \"Anno 1311. Schavaldos insurgentes in Episcopatu (Richardus episcopus) fortiter composuit. Aliqui suspendebantur, aliqui extra Episcopatum fugabantur.\")\n In Spelman also (Glossarium Archaiologicum, 1688) we find:-\n \"Scavagium.] Tributum quod a mercatoribus exigere solent nundinarum domini, ob licentiam proponendi ibidem venditioni mercimonia, a Saxon (sceawian) id est, Ostendere, inspicere, Angl. schewage and shewage.\" Spelman has no Scavenger or Scavager.\n The scavage then was a tax upon goods for sale which were liable to duty, the word being, as Skeat points out, a Law French (or Low Latin?) formation from shew. [\"From O.F. escauw-er, to examine, inspect. O. Sax. skawon, to behold; cognate with A.S. sceawian, to look at.\" (Concise Dict. s.v.)] And the scavager or scavenger was originally the officer charged with the inspection of the goods and collection of this tax. Passages quoted below from the Liber Albus of the City of London refer to these officers, and Mr. Riley in his translation of that work (1861, p. 34) notes that they were \"Officers whose duty it was originally to take custom upon the Scavage, i.e. inspection of the opening out, of imported goods. At a later date, part of their duty was to see that the streets were kept clean; and hence the modern word 'scavenger,' whose office corresponds with the rakyer (raker) of former times.\" [The meaning and derivation of this word have been discussed in Notes & Queries, 2 ser. ix. 325; 5 ser. v. 49, 452.]\n We can hardly doubt then that the office of the Coromandel scavenger of the 18th century, united as we find it with that of \"Rentall General,\" or of Land-customer,\" and held by a senior member of the Company's Covenanted Service, must be understood in the older sense of Visitor or Inspector of Goods subject to duties, but (till we can find more light) we should suppose rather duties of the nature of bazar tax, such as at a later date we find classed as sayer (q.v.), than customs on imports from seaward.\n It still remains an obscure matter how the charge of the scavagers or scavengers came to be transferred to the oversight of streets and streetcleaning. That this must have become a predominant part of their duty at an early period is shown by the Scavager's Oath which we quote below from the Liber Albus. In Skinner's Etymologicon, 1671, the definition is Collector sordium abrasarum (erroneously connecting the word with shaving and scraping), whilst he adds: \"Nostri Scavengers vilissimo omnium ministerio sordes et purgamenta urbis auferendi funguntur.\" In Cotgrave's English-French Dict., ed. by Howel, 1673, we have: \"Scavinger. Boueur. Gadouard\" -- agreeing precisely with our modern use. Neither of these shows any knowledge of the less sordid office attaching to the name. The same remark applies to Lye's Junius, 1743. It is therefore remarkable to find such a survival of the latter sense in the service of the Company, and coming down so late as 1761. It must have begun with the very earliest of the Company's establishments in India, for it is probable that the denomination was even then only a survival in England, due to the Company's intimate connection with the city of London. Indeed we learn from Mr. Norton, quoted below, that the term scavage was still alive within the City in 1829.\n 1268. -- \"Walterus Hervy et Willelmus de Dunolmo, Ballivi, ut Custodes . . . de Lxxv.l. vj.s. & xd. de consuetudinibus omnemodarum mercandisarum venientium de partibus transmarinis ad Civitatem praedictam, de quibus consuetudo debetur quae vocatur Scavagium. . . .\" -- Mag.

Hind. from Pers. sihband\u012b (sih, 'three'). The rationale of the word is obscure to us. [Platts says it means 'three-monthly or quarterly payment.' The Madras Gloss. less probably suggests Pers. sip\u0101hband\u012b (see SEPOY), 'recruitment.'] It is applied to irregular native soldiery, a sort of militia, or imperfectly disciplined troops for revenue or police duties, &c. Certain local infantry regiments were formerly officially termed Sebundy. The last official appearance of the title that we can find is in application to \"The Sebundy Corps of Sappers and Miners\" employed at Darjeeling. This is in the E.I. Register down to July, 1869, after which the title does not appear in any official list. Of this corps, if we are not mistaken, the late FieldMarshal Lord Napier of Magdala was in charge, as Lieut. Robert Napier, about 1840. An application to Lord Napier, for corroboration of this reminiscence of many years back, drew from him the following interesting note:-\n \"Captain Gilmore of the (Bengal) Engineers was appointed to open the settlement of Darjeeling, and to raise two companies of Sebundy Sappers, in order to provide the necessary labour.\n \"He commenced the work, obtained some (Native) officers and N.C. officers from the old Bengal Sappers, and enlisted about half of each company.\n \"The first season found the little colony quite unprepared for the early commencement of the Rains. All the Coolies, who did not die, fled, and some of the Sappers deserted. Gilmore got sick; and in 1838 I was suddenly ordered from the extreme border of Bengal -- Nyacollee -- to relieve him for one month. I arrived somehow, with a pair of pitarahs as my sole possession.\n \"Just then, our relations with Nepaul became strained, and it was thought desirable to complete the Sebundy Sappers with men from the Border Hills unconnected with Nepaul -- Garrows and similar tribes. Through the Political Officer the necessary number of men were enlisted and sent to me.\n \"When they arrived I found, instead of the 'fair recruits' announced, a number of most unfit men; some of them more or less crippled, or with defective sight. It seemed probable that, by the process known to us in India as uddlee buddlee (see BUDLEE), the original recruits had managed to insert substitutes during the journey! I was much embarrassed as to what I should do with them; but night was coming on, so I encamped them on the newly opened road, the only clear space amid the dense jungle on either side. To complete my difficulty it began to rain, and I pitied my poor recruits! During the night there was a storm -- and in the morning, to my intense relief, they had all disappeared!\n \"In the expressive language of my sergeant, there was not a 'visage' of the men left.\n \"The Sebundies were a local corps, designed to furnish a body of labourers fit for mountain-work. They were armed, and expected to fight if necessary. Their pay was 6rs. a month, instead of a Sepoy's 7\u00bd. The pensions of the Native officers were smaller than in the regular army, which was a ground of complaint with the Bengal Sappers, who never expected in accepting the new service that they would have lower pensions than those they enlisted for.\n \"I eventually completed the corps with Nepaulese, and, I think, left them in a satisfactory condition.\n \"I was for a long time their only sergeantmajor. I supplied the Native officers and N.C. officers from India with a good peajacket each, out of my private means, and with a little gold-lace made them smart and happy.\n \"When I visited Darjeeling again in 1872, I found the remnant of my good Sapper officers living as pensioners, and waiting to give me an affectionate welcome.\n * * * * * \"My month's acting appointment was turned into four years. I walked 30 miles to get to the place, lived much in hovels and temporary huts thrown up by my Hill-men, and derived more benefit from the climate than from my previous visit to England. I think I owe much practical teaching to the Hill-men, the Hills and the Climate. I learnt the worst the elements could do to me -- very nearly -- excepting earthquakes! And I think I was thus prepared for any hard work.\"\n c. 1778. -- \"At Dacca I made acquaintance with my venerable friend John Cowe.

Of these at least one family has survived in princely position to our own day, viz. the Naw\u0101b of Jang\u012bra (see JUNGEERA), near Bombay. The young heir to this principality, Siddh\u012b Ahmad, after a minority of some years, was installed in the Government in Oct., 1883.

India, ii. 789.]\n", "seer": "s. Hind. ser; Skt. setak. One of the most generally spread Indian denominations of weight, though, like all Indian measures, varying widely in different parts of the country. And besides the variations of local ser and ser we often find in the same locality a pakk\u0101 (pucka) and a kachchh\u0101 (cutcha) ser; a state of things, however, which is human, and not Indian only (see under PUCKA). The ser is generally (at least in upper India) equivalent to 80 tolas or rupee-weights; but even this is far from universally true. The heaviest ser in the Useful Tables (see Thomas's ed. of Prinsep) is that called \"Coolpahar,\" equivalent to 123 tolas, and weighing 3 lbs. 1 oz. 6\u00bc dr. avoird.; the lightest is the ser of Malabar and the S. Mahratta country, which is little more than 8 oz. [The Macleod ser of Malabar, introduced in 1802, is of 130 tolas; 10 of these weigh 33 lb. (Madras Man. ii. 516).]\n Regulation VII. of the Govt. of India of 1833 is entitled \"A Reg. for altering the weight of the Furruckabad Rupee (see RUPEE) and for assimilating it to the legal currency of the Madras and Bombay Presidencies; for adjusting the weight of the Company's sicca Rupee, and for fixing a standard unit of weight for India.\" This is the nearest thing to the establishment of standard weights that existed up to 1870. The preamble says: \"It is further convenient to introduce the weight of the Furruckabad Rupee as the unit of a general system of weights for Government transactions throughout India.\" And Section IV. contains the following:\n \"The Tola or Sicca weight to be equal to 180 grains troy, and the other denominations or weights to be derived from this unit, according to the following scale:-\n 8 Rutties = 1 Masha = 15 troy grains. 12 Mashas = 1 Tola = 180 ditto. 80 Tolas (or sicca weight) = 1 Seer= 2\u00bd lbs. troy. 40 Seers = 1 Mun or Bazar Maund = 100 lbs. troy.\"\n Section VI. of the same Regulation says:\n \"The system of weights and measures(?) described in Section IV. is to be adopted at the mints and assay offices of Calcutta and Saugor respectively in the adjustment and verification of all weights for government or public purposes sent thither for examination.\"\n But this does not go far in establishing a standard unit of weight for India: though the weights detailed in \u0015 iv. became established for Government purposes in the Bengal Presidency. The seer of this Regulation was thus 14,400 grains troy -- 2\u00bd lbs. troy, 2\u00b7057 lbs. avoirdupois.\n In 1870, in the Government of Lord Mayo, a strong movement was made by able and influential men to introduce the metrical system, and an Act was passed called \"The Indian Weights and Measures Act\" (Act XI. of 1870) to pave the way for this. The preamble declares it expedient to provide for the ultimate adoption of an uniform system of weights and measures thoughout British India, and the Act prescribes certain standards, with powers to the Local Governments to declare the adoption of these.\n Section II. runs:\n \"Standards. -- The primary standard of weight shall be called ser, and shall be a weight of metal in the possession of the Government of India, which weight, when weighed in a vacuum, is equal to the weight known in France as the kilogramme des Archives.\"\n Again, Act XXXI. of 1872, called \"The Indian Weights and Measures of Capacity Act,\" repeats in substance the same preamble and prescription of standard weight. It is not clear to us what the separate object of this second Act was. But with the death of Lord Mayo the whole scheme fell to the ground. The ser of these Acts would be=2\u00b72 lbs. avoirdupois, or 0\u00b7143 of a pound greater than the 80 tola ser.\n 1554. -- \"Porto Grande de Bemgala. -- 'The maund (ma\u0303o) with which they weigh all merchandize is of 40 ceres, each cer 18\u2156 ounces; the said maund weights 46\u00bd arratels (rottle).\" -- A.

That name would appear to belong properly to the well-known saw-fish (Pristis) -- see Bluteau, quoted below; but probably it may have been applied to the fish now in question, because of the serrated appearance of the rows of finlets, behind the second dorsal and anal fins, which are characteristic of the genus (see Day's Fishes of India, pp. 254-256, and plates lv., lvi.).\n 1554. -- \"E aos Marinheiros hum peixe cerra par mes, a cada hum.\" -- A.

This word is used to represent two Oriental words entirely different.\n a. Hind. from Pers. sar\u0101, sar\u0101\u012b. This means originally an edifice, a palace. It was especially used by the Tartars when they began to build palaces. Hence Sar\u0101\u012b, the name of more than one royal residence of the Mongol Kh\u0101ns upon the Volga, the Sarra of Chaucer. The Russians retained the word from their Tartar oppressors, but in their language sarai has been degraded to mean 'a shed.' The word, as applied to the Palace of the Grand Turk, became, in the language of the Levantine Franks, serail and serraglio. In this form, as P. della Valle lucidly explains below, the \"striving after meaning\" connected the word with Ital. serrato, 'shut up'; and with a word serraglio perhaps previously existing in Italian in that connection. [Seraglio, according to Prof. Skeat (Concise Dict. s.v.) is \"formed with suffix-aglio (L. -aculum) from Late Lat. serare, 'to bar, shut in' -- Lat. sera, a 'bar, bolt'; Lat. serere, 'to join together.'] It is this association that has attached the meaning of 'women's apartments' to the word. Sarai has no such specific sense.\n But the usual modern meaning in Persia, and the only one in India, is that of a building for the accommodation of travellers with their packanimals; consisting of an enclosed yard with chambers round it.\n Recurring to the Italian use, we have-seen in Italy the advertisement of a travelling menagerie as Serraglio di Belve. A friend tells us of an old Scotchman whose ideas must have run in this groove, for he used to talk of 'a Serragle of blackguards.' In the Diary in England of Annibale Litolfi of Mantua the writer says: \"On entering the tower there is a Serraglio in which, from grandeur, they keep lions and tigers and cat-lions.\" (See Rawdon Brown's Calendar of Papers in Archives of Venice, vol. vi. pt. iii. 1557-8.

But since this word serai resembles serraio, as a Venetian would call it, or seraglio as we say, and seeing that the palace of the Turk is (serrato or) shut up all round by a strong wall, and also because the women and a great part of the courtiers dwell in it barred up and shut in, so it may perchance have seemed to some to have deserved such a name.

In the Land Revenue system of India, an estate or district is said to be settled, when instead of taking a quota of the year's produce the Government has agreed with the cultivators, individually or in community, for a fixed sum to be paid at several periods of the year, and not liable to enhancement during the term of years for which the agreement or settlement is made. The operation of arranging the terms of such an agreement, often involving tedious and complicated considerations and enquiries, is known as the process of settlement. A Permanent Settlement is that in which the annual payment is fixed in perpetuity.

The latter author gives the native name as Seven Brothers, which is the form also given in the quotation below from Tribes on My Frontier. The bird is so named from being constantly seen in little companies of about that number. Its characteristics are well given in the quotations. See also Jerdon's Birds (Godwin-Austen's ed., ii. 59).

Sketches, Madras reprint, i. 228, ii. 232) calls it Savendy Droog, and Savendroog. ]\n", "seychelle islands": "n.p. A cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean, politically subordinate to the British Government of Mauritius, lying bebetween 3\u02da 40' & 4\u02da 50' S. Lat., and about 950 sea-miles east of Mombas on the E. African coast. There are 29 or 30 of the Seychelles proper, of which Mah\u00e9, the largest, is about 17 m. long by 3 or 4 wide. The principal islands are granitic, and rise \"in the centre of a vast plateau of coral\" of some 120 m. diameter.\n These islands are said to have been visited by Soares in 1506, and were known vaguely to the Portuguese navigators of the 16th century as the Seven Brothers (Os sete Irmanos or Hermanos), sometimes Seven Sisters (Sete Irmanas), whilst in Delisle's Map of Asia (1700) we have both \"les Sept Fr\u00e8res\" and \"les Sept S\u0153urs.\" Adjoining these on the W. or S.W. we find also on the old maps a group called the Almirantes, and this group has retained that name to the present day, constituting now an appendage of the Seychelles.\n The islands remained uninhabited, and apparently unvisited, till near the middle of the 18th century. In 1742 the celebrated Mah\u00e9 de la Bourdonnais, who was then Governor of Mauritius and the Isle of Bourbon, despatched two small vessels to explore the islands of this little archipelago, an expedition which was renewed by Lazare Picault, the commander of one of the two vessels, in 1774, who gave to the principal island the name of Mah\u00e9, and to the group the name of Iles de Bourdonnais, for which Iles Mah\u00e9 (which is the name given in the Neptune Orientale of D'Apres de Manneville, 1775, pp. 29-38, and the charts), seems to have been substituted. Whatever may have been La Bourdonnais' plans with respect to these islands, they were interrupted by his engagement in the Indian campaigns of 1745-46, and his government of Mauritius was never resumed. In 1756 the Sieur Morphey (Murphy?), commander of the frigate Le Cerf, was sent by M. Magon, Governor of Mauritius and Bourbon, to take possession of the Island of Mah\u00e9. But it seems doubtful if any actual settlement of the islands by the French occurred till after 1769. [See the account of the islands in Owen's Narrative, ii. 158 seqq.]\n A question naturally has suggested itself to us as to how the group came by the name of the Seychelles Islands; and it is one to which no trustworthy answer will be easily found in English, if at all. Even French works of pretension (e.g. the Dictionnaire de la Rousse) are found to state that the islands were named after the \"Minister of Marine, Herault de S\u00e9chelles, who was eminent for his services and his able administration. He was the first to establish a French settlement there.\" This is quoted from La Rousse; but the fact is that the only man of the name known to fame is the Jacobin and friend of Danton, along with whom he perished by the guillotine. There never was a Minister of Marine so called! The name S\u00e9chelles first (so far as we can learn) appears in the Hydrographie Fran\u00e7aise of Belin, 1767, where in a map entitled Carte r\u00e9duite du Canal de Mozambique the islands are given as Les Iles S\u00e9cheyles, with two enlarged plans en cartouche of the Port de S\u00e9cheyles. In 1767 also Chev. de Grenier, commanding the Heure du Berger, visited the Islands, and in his narrative states that he had with him the chart of Picault, \"envoy\u00e9 par La Bourdonnais pour reconno\u00eetre les isles des Sept Fr\u00e8res, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis nomm\u00e9e iles Mah\u00e9 et ensuite iles S\u00e9chelles.\" We have not been able to learn by whom the latter name was given, but it was probably by Morphey of the Cerf; for among Dalrymple's Charts (pub. 1771), there is a \"Plan of the Harbour adjacent to Bat River on the Island Seychelles, from a French plan made in 1756, published by Bellin.\" And there can be no doubt that the name was bestowed in honour of Moreau de S\u00e9chelles, who was Contr\u00f4leur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Finances in France in 1754-56, i.e. at the very time when Governor Magon sent Capt. Morphey to take possession. One of the islands again is called Silhouette, the name of an official who had been Commissaire du roi pr\u00e8s la Compagnie des Indes, and succeeded Moreau de S\u00e9chelles as Controller of Finance; and another is called Praslin, apparently after the Duc de Choiseul Praslin who was Minister of Marine from 1766 to 1770.\n The exact date of the settlement of the islands we have not traced. We can only say that it must have been between 1769 and 1772. The quotation below from the Abb\u00e9 Rochon shows that the islands were not settled when he visited them in 1769; whilst that from Capt. Neale shows that they were settled before his visit in 1772. It will be seen that both Rochon and Neale speak of Mah\u00e9 as \"the island Seychelles, or S\u00e9cheyles,\" as in Belin's chart of 1767. It seems probable that the cloud under which La Bourdonnais fell, on his return to France, must have led to the suppression of his name in connection with the group.\n The islands surrendered to the English Commodore Newcome in 1794, and were formally ceded to England with Mauritius in 1815. Seychelles appears to be an erroneous English spelling, now however become established. (For valuable assistance in the preceding article we are indebted to the courteous communications of M.

This was the title of an officer at native ports all over the Indian seas, who was the chief authority with whom foreign traders and ship-masters had to transact. He was often also head of the Customs. Hence the name is of prominent and frequent occurrence in the old narratives. Portuguese authors generally write the word Xabander; ours Shabunder or Sabundar. The title is not obsolete, though it does not now exist in India; the quotation from Lane shows its recent existence in Cairo, [and the Persians still call their Consuls Sh\u0101h-bandar (Burton, Ar. Nights, iii. 158)]. In the marine Malay States the Sh\u0101bandar was, and probably is, an important officer of State.

This name properly belongs to the West Indies, having been given, according to Grainger, from that of the Englishman who first brought the fruit thither from the East, and who was, according to Crawfurd, an interloper captain, who traded to the Archipelago about the time of the Revolution, and is mentioned by his contemporary Dampier. The fruit is the same as the pommelo (q.v.). And the name appears from a modern quotation below to be now occasionally used in India. [Nothing definite seems to be known of this Capt. Shaddock. Mr. R. C. A. Prior (7 ser. N. & Q., vii. 375) writes: \"Lunan, in 'Hortus Jamaicensis,' vol. ii. p. 171, says, 'This fruit is not near so large as the shaddock, which received its name from a Capt. Shaddock, who first brought the plant from the East Indies.' The name of the captain is believed to have been Shattock, one not uncommon in the west of Somersetshire. Sloane, in his 'Voyage to Jamaica,' 1707, vol. i. p. 41 says, 'The seed of this was first brought to Barbados by one Capt. Shaddock, commander of an East Indian ship, who touch'd at that island in his passage to England, and left its seed there.'\" Watt (Econ.

The oldest form, in use at the beginning of the last century, was a tall glass cylinder which stood on the table, the candlestick and candle being placed bodily within in. In later days the universal form has been that of an inverted dome fitting into the candlestick, which has an annular socket to receive it. The wall-shade is a bracket attached to the wall, bearing a candle or cocoa-nut oil lamp, protected by such a shade. In the wine-drinking days of the earlier part of last century it was sometimes the subject of a challenge, or forfeit, for a man to empty a wall-shade filled with claret.

This English word, -- French chagrin; Ital. zigrino; Mid. High Ger.

Diez considers the French (and English adopted) chagrin in the sense of vexation to be the same word, as certain hard skins prepared in this way were used as files, and hence the word is used figuratively for gnawing vexation, as (he states) the Ital. lima also is (Etym. Worterbuch, ed. 1861, ii. 240). He might have added the figurative origin of tribulation.

Napier by the Am\u012brs of Sind and their followers. He was not the first great English soldier to whom this title had been applied in the East. In the romance of C\u0153ur de Lion, when Richard entertains a deputation of Saracens by serving at table the head of one of their brethren, we are told:\n \"Every man sat stylle and pokyd othir; They saide: 'This is the Develys brothir, That sles our men, and thus hem eetes. . .\"\n [c. 1630. -- \"But a Mountebank or Impostor is nick-named Shitan.

We have a little doubt as to the identity of all these words; the two latter occur in old works as names of cotton stuffs; the first two (Shakespear and Fallon give s\u0101l\u016b) are names in familiar use for a soft twilled cotton stuff, of a Turkeyred colour, somewhat resembling what we call, by what we had judged to be a modification of the word, shaloon. But we find that Skeat and other authorities ascribe the latter word to a corruption of Chalons, which gave its name to certain stuffs, apparently bed-coverlets of some sort. Thus in Chaucer:\n \"With shetes and with chalons faire yspredde.\" -- The Reve's Tale.\n On which Tyrwhitt quotes from the Monasticon,\" . . . aut pannos pictos qui vocantur chalons loco lectisternii.\" See also in Liber Albus:\n \"La charge de chalouns et draps de Reynes. . . .\" -- p. 225, also at p. 231.\n c. 1343. -- \"I went then to Sh\u0101liy\u0101t (near Calicut -- see CHALIA) a very pretty town, where they make the stuffs (qu. sh\u0101l\u012b?) that bear its name.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iv. 109.\n [It is exceedingly difficult to disentangle the meanings and derivations of this series of words. In the first place we have saloo, Hind. s\u0101l\u016b, the Turkey-red cloth above described; a word which is derived by Platts from Skt. \u015b\u0101l\u016b, 'a kind of astringent substance, ' and is perhaps the same word as the Tel. s\u0101l\u016b, 'cloth.'

The Macedonians who dwell among the Indians, in the city of Bucephala and thereabouts . . . call the bird KERKI/WN ('Taily'); and the name arose from the fact that the bird twitches his tail just like a wagtail.\" -- Aelian, de Nat.

These terms are applied in modern times to superstitions of the kind that connects itself with exorcism and \"devil-dancing\" as their most prominent characteristic, and which are found to prevail with wonderful identity of circumstance among nonCaucasian races over parts of the earth most remote from one another; not only among the vast variety of Indo-Chinese tribes, but among the Dravidian tribes of India, the Veddahs of Ceylon, the races of Siberia, and the red nations of N. and S. America. \"Hinduism has assimilated these 'prior superstitions of the sons of Tur,' as Mr. Hodgson calls them, in the form of Tantrika mysteries, whilst, in the wild performance of the Dancing Dervishes at Constantinople, we see, perhaps, again, the infection of Turanian blood breaking out from the very heart of Mussulman orthodoxy\" (see Notes to Marco Polo, Bk. II. ch. 50). The characteristics of Shamanism is the existence of certain sooth-sayers or medicine-men, who profess a special art of dealing with the mischievous spirits who are supposed to produce illness and other calamities, and who invoke these spirits and ascertain the means of appeasing them, in trance produced by fantastic ceremonies and convulsive dancings.\n The immediate origin of the term is the title of the spirit-conjuror in the Tunguz language, which is shaman, in that of the Manchus becoming saman, pl. samasa. But then in Chinese Sha-m\u0103n or Shi-m\u0103n is used for a Buddhist ascetic, and this would seem to be taken from the Skt. \u015bramana, Pali samana. Whether the Tanguz word is in any way connected with this or adopted from it, is a doubtful question. W. Schott, who has treated the matter elaborately (\u00d9ber den Doppelsinn des Wortes Schamane und \u00fcber den tungusichen Schamanen-Cultus am Hofe der Mandju Kaisern, Berlin Akad. 1842), finds it difficult to suppose any connection.

To knead and press the muscles with the view of relieving fatigue, &c. The word has now long been familiarly used in England. The Hind. verb is ch\u0101mpn\u0101, from the imperative of which, ch\u0101mpo\u0304, this is most probably a corruption, as in the case of Bunow, Puckerow, &c. The process is described, though not named, by Terry, in 1616: \"Taking thus their ease, they often call their Barbers, who tenderly gripe and smite their Armes and other parts of their bodies instead of exercise, to stirre the bloud. It is a pleasing wantonnesse, and much valued in these hot climes.\" (In Purchas, ii. 1475). The process was familiar to the Romans under the Empire, whose slaves employed in this way were styled tractator and tractatrix.

Mem. i. 35; [2nd ed. i. 25.]\n", "shan": "n.p. The name which we have learned from the Burmese to apply to the people who call themselves the great T'ai, kindred to the Siamese, and occupying extensive tracts in Indo-China, intermediate between Burma, Siam, and China. They are the same people that have been known, after the Portuguese, and some of the early R. C. Missionaries, as Laos (q.v.); but we now give the name an extensive signification covering the whole race. The Siamese, who have been for centuries politically the most important branch of this race, call (or did call themselves -- see De la Loub\u00e8re, who is very accurate) T'ai-Noe or 'Little T'ai,' whilst they applied the term T'ai-Yai, or 'Great T'ai,' to their northern kindred or some part of these;* sometimes also calling the latter T'ai-giit, or the 'Ta'i left behind.' The T'ai or Shan are certainly the most numerous and widely spread race in Indo-China, and innumerable petty Shan States exist on the borders of Burma, Siam, and China, more or less dependent on, or tributary to, their powerful neighbours. They are found from the extreme north of the Irawadi Valley, in the vicinity of Assam, to the borders of Camboja; and in nearly all we find, to a degree unusual in the case of populations politically so segregated, a certain homogeneity in language, civilisation, and religion (Buddhist), which seems to point to their former union in considerable States.\n One branch of the race entered and conquered Assam in the 13th century, and from the name by which they were known, Ahom or Aham, was derived, by the frequent exchange of aspirant and sibilant, the name, just used, of the province itself. The most extensive and central Shan State, which occupied a position between Ava and Yunnan, is known in the Shan traditions as Mung-Mau, and in Burma by the Buddhisto-classical name of Kau\u015b\u0101mbi (from a famous city of that name in ancient India) corrupted by a usual process into Ko-Shan-pyi and interpreted to mean 'Nine-ShanStates.' Further south were those T'ai States which have usually been called Laos, and which formed several considerable kingdoms, going through many vicissitudes of power. Several On the probable indication of Great and Little used in this fashion, see remarks in notes on Marco Polo, bk. iii. ch. 9.\n of their capitals were visited and their ruins described by the late Francis Garnier, and the cities of these and many smaller States of the same race, all built on the same general quadrangular plan, are spread broadcast over that part of Indo-China which extends from Siam north of Yunnan.\n Mr. Cushing, in the Introduction to his Shan Dictionary (Rangoon, 1881), divides the Shan family by dialectic indications into the Ahoms, whose language is now extinct, the Chinese Shan (occupying the central territory of what was Mau or Kau\u015b\u0101mbi), the Shan (Proper, or Burmese Shan), Laos (or Siamese Shan), and Siamese.\n The term Shan is borrowed from the Burmese, in whose peculiar orthography the name, though pronounced Sh\u0101n, is written rham. We have not met with its use in English prior to the Mission of Col. Symes in 1795. It appears in the map illustrating his narrative, and once or twice in the narrative itself, and it was frequently used by his companion, F. Buchanan, whose papers were only published many years afterwards in various periodicals difficult to meet with. It was not until the Burmese war of 1824-1826, and the active investigation of our Eastern frontier which followed, that the name became popularly known in British India. The best notice of the Shans that we are acquainted with is a scarce pamphlet by Mr. Ney Elias, printed by the Foreign Dept. of Calcutta in 1876 (Introd. Sketch of the Hist. of the Shans, &c.). [The ethnology of the race is discussed by J. G. Scott, Upper Burma Gazetteer, i. pt. i. 187 seqq. Also see Prince Henri d'Orleans, Du Tonkin aux Indes, 1898; H. S. Hallett, Among the Shans, 1885, and A Thousand Miles on an Elephant, 1890.]\n Though the name as we have taken it is a Burmese oral form, it seems to be essentially a genuine ethnic name for the race. It is applied in the form Sam by the Assamese, and the Kakhyens; the Siamese themselves have an obsolete Si\u1ebdm (written Sieyam) for themselves, and Sieng (Sieyang) for the Laos. The former word is evidently the Sien, which the Chinese used in the compound Sien-lo (for Siam, -- see Marco Polo, 2nd ed. Bk. iii. ch. 7, note 3), and from which we got, probably through a Malay medium, our Siam (q.v.). The Burmese distinguish the Siamese Shans as Yudia (see JUDEA) Shans, a term perhaps sometimes including Siam itself. Symes gives this (through Arakanese corruption) as 'YoodraShaan,' and he also (no doubt improperly) calls the Manip\u016br people 'Cassay Shaan' (see CASSAY).\n 1795. -- \"These events did not deter Shanbuan from pursuing his favourite scheme of conquest to the westward. The fertile plains and populous towns of Munnipoora and the Cassay Shaan, attracted his ambition. \" -- Symes, p. 77.\n \" \"Zemee (see JANGOMAY), Sandapoora, and many districts of the Yoodra Shaan to the eastward, were tributary, and governed by Chobwas, who annually paid homage to the Birman king.\" -- Ibid. 102.\n \" \"Shaan, or Shan, is a very comprehensive term given to different nations, some independent, others the subjects of the greater states.\" -- Ibid. 274.\n c. 1818. -- \". . . They were assisted by many of the Zabo\u00e0 (see CHOBWA) or petty princes of the Sciam, subject to the Burmese, who, wearied by the oppressions and exactions of the Burmese Mandarins and generals, had revolted, and made common cause with the enemies of their cruel masters. . . . The war which the Burmese had to support with these enemies was long and disastrous . . . instead of overcoming the Sciam (they) only lost day by day the territories . . . and saw their princes range themselves . . . under the protection of the King of Siam.\" -- Sangermano, p. 57.\n 1861.- \"Fie, Fie!

The Persian is shalw\u0101r, which according to Prof. Max M\u00fcller is more correctly shulv\u0101r, from shul, 'the thigh,' related to Latin crus, cruris, and to Skt. kshura or khura, 'hoof' (see Pusey on Daniel, 570). Be this as it may, the Ar. form is sirw\u0101l (vulg. sharw\u0101l), pl. sar\u0101w\u012bl, [which Burton (Arab. Nights, i. 205) translates 'bag-trousers' and 'petticoat-trousers,' \"the latter being the divided skirt of the future.\"] This appears in the ordinary editions of the Book of Daniel in Greek, as SARA/BARA, and also in the Vulgate, as follows: \"Et capillus capitis eorum non esset adustus, et sarabala eorum non fuissent immutata, et odor ignis non transisset per eos\" (iii. 27). The original word is sarb\u0101l\u012bn, pl. of sarb\u0101la. Luther, however, renders this Mantel; as the A.V. also does by coats; [the R.V. hosen]. On this Prof. RobertsonSmith writes:\n \"It is not certain but that Luther and the A.V. are right. The word sarb\u0101l\u012bn means 'cloak' in the Gemara; and in Arabic sirb\u0101l is 'a garment, a coat of mail.' Perhaps quite an equal weight of scholarship would now lean (though with hesitation) towards the cloak or coat, and against the breeches theory.\n \"The Arabic word occurs in the Traditions of the Prophet (Bokh\u0101ri, vii. 36).\n \"Of course it is certain that SARA/BARA comes from the Persian, but not through Arabic. The Bedouins did not wear trowsers in the time of Ammianus, and don't do so now.\n \"The ordinary so-called LXX. editions of Daniel contain what is really the postChristian version of Theodotion. The true LXX. text has U(PODH/MATA.\n \"It may be added that Jerome says that both Aquila and Symmachus wrote saraballa. \" [The Encycl. Biblica also prefers the rendering of the A.V. (i. 607), and see iii. 2934.]\n The word is widely spread as well as old; it is found among the Tartars of W. Asia as j\u0101lb\u0101r, among the Siberians and Bashkirds as s\u0101lb\u0101r, among the Kalmaks as sh\u0101lb\u016br, whilst it reached Russia as sharawari, Spain as zaraguelles, and Portugal as zarelos. A great many Low Latin variations of the word will be found in Ducange, serabula, serabulla, sarabella, sarabola, sarabura, and more! [And Crawfurd (Desc. Dict. 124) writes of Malay dress: \"Trowsers are occasionally used under the sarung by the richer classes, and this portion of dress, like the imitation of the turban, seems to have been borrowed from the Arabs, as is implied by its Arabic name, sarual, corrupted saluwar.\"]\n In the second quotation from Isidore of Seville below it will be seen that the word had in some cases been interpreted as 'turbans.'\n A.D.

From them we presume the Portuguese took their Reyno de Sia\u0303o as Barros and Couto write it, though we have in Correa Siam precisely as we write it. Cam\u00f5es also writes Sya\u0303o for the kingdom; and the statement of De la Loub\u00e8re quoted below that the Portuguese used Siam as a national, not a geographical, ex pression cannot be accepted in its generality, accurate as that French writer usually is. It is true that both Barros and F. M. Pinto use os Siames for the nation, and the latter also uses the adjective form o reyno Siame. But he also constantly says rey de Sia\u0303o. The origin of the name would seem to be a term Sien, or Siam, identical with Shan (q.v.). \"The kingdom of Siam is known to the Chinese by the name Sien-lo. . . . The supplement to Matwanlin's Encyclop\u0153dia describes Sien-lo as on the seaboard, to the extreme south of Chen-ching (or Cochin China). 'It originally consisted of two kingdoms, Sien and Lo-hoh. The Sien people are the remains of a tribe which in the year (A.D. 1341) began to come down upon the Lo-hoh and united with the latter into one nation.'\" See Marco Polo, 2nd ed., Bk. iii. ch. 7, note 3. The considerations there adduced indicate that the Lo who occupied the coast of the Gulf before the descent of the Sien, belonged to the Laotian Shans, Thainyai, or Great T'ai, whilst the Sien or Siamese Proper were the T'ai Noi, or Little T'ai. (See also SARNAU.) [\"The name Siam . . . whether it is 'a barbarous Anglicism derived from the Portuguese or Italian word Sciam,' or is derived from the Malay Sayam, which means 'brown.'\" -- J. G.

As will be seen by reference to the article RUPEE , up to 1835 a variety of rupees had been coined in the Company's territories. The term sicca (sikk\u0101, from Ar. sikka, 'a coining die,' -- and 'coined money,' -- whence Pers. sikka zadan, 'to coin') had been applied to newly coined rupees, which were at a batta or premium over those worn, or assumed to be worn, by use. In 1793 the Government of Bengal, with a view to terminating, as far as that Presidency was concerned, the confusion and abuses engendered by this system, ordered that all rupees coined for the future should bear the impress of the 19th year of Sh\u0101h 'Alam (the \"Great Mogul\" then reigning), and this rupee, \"19 San Sikkah,\" 'struck in the 19th year,' was to be the legal tender in Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa. This rupee, which is the Sicca of more recent monetary history, weighed 192 grs. troy, and then contained 176\u00b713 grs. of pure silver. The \"Company's Rupee,\" which introduced uniformity of coinage over British India in 1835, contained only 165 grs. silver. Hence the Sicca bore to the Company's Rupee (which was based on the old Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d rupee) the proportion of 16:15 nearly. The Sicca was allowed by Act VII. of 1833 to survive as an exceptional coin in Bengal, but was abolished as such in 1836. It continued, however, a ghostly existence for many years longer in the form of certain Government Book-debts in that currency. (See also CHICK.)\n 1537. -- \". . .

No Indian name like this has yet been recovered from inscriptions as attaching to Goa; but the Turkish author of the Mohit supplies the connection, and Ibn Batuta's description even without this would be sufficient for the identification. His description, it will be seen, is that of a delta-island, and Goa is the only one partaking of that character upon the coast. He says it contained 36 villages; and Barros tells us that Goa Island was known to the natives as T\u012bsv\u0101\u1e0d\u012b, a name signifying \"Thirty villages.\" (See SALSETTE.) Its vicinity to the island where Ibn Batuta proceeded to anchor, which we have shown to be Anchediva (q.v.), is another proof. Turning to Rash\u012bdudd\u012bn, the order in which he places Sind\u0101b\u016br, Fakn\u016br (Baccanore), Manjar\u016br (Mangalore), H\u012bl\u012b (Mt. D'Ely), is perfectly correct, if for Sind\u0101b\u016br we substitute Goa. The passage from Edrisi and one indicated from Abulfeda only show a confusion which has misled many readers since.\n", "singalese": "n.p. Native of Ceylon; pertaining to Ceylon. The word is formed from Si\u1e49hala, 'Dwelling of Lions,' the word used by the natives for the Island, and which is the origin of most of the names given to it (see CEYLON).

This name was adopted by Sir Stamford Raffles in favour of the city which he founded, February 23, 1819, on the island which had always retained the name since the Middle Ages. This it derived from Si\u1e49hapura, Skt. 'Lioncity,' the name of a town founded by Malay or Javanese settlers from Sumatra, probably in the 14th century, and to which Barros ascribes great commercial importance. The Indian origin of the name, as of many other names and phrases which survive from the old Indian civilisation of the Archipelago, had been forgotten, and the origin which Barros was taught to ascribe to it is on a par with his etymology of Singalese quoted in the preceding article. The words on which his etymology is founded are no doubt Malay: singah, 'to tarry, halt, or lodge,' and pora-pora, 'to pretend'; and these were probably supposed to refer to the temporary occupation of Sinhapura, before the chiefs who founded it passed on to Malacca. [It may be noted that Dennys (Desc. Dict. s.v.) derives the word from singha, 'a place of call,' and pura, 'a city.' In Dalboquerque's Comm. Hak. Soc. iii. 73, we are told: \"Singapura, whence the city takes its name, is a channel through which all the shipping of those parts passes, and signifies in his Malay language, 'treacherous delay'\" See quotation from Barros below.]\n The settlement of Hinduized people on the site, if not the name, is probably as old as the 4th century, A.D., for inscriptions have been found there in a very old character. One of these, on a rock at the mouth of the little river on which the town stands, was destroyed some 40 or 50 years ago for the accommodation of some wretched bungalow.\n The modern Singapore and its prosperity form a monument to the patriotism, sagacity, and fervid spirit of the founder. According to an article in the Geogr. Magazine (i. 107) derived from Mr. Archibald Ritchie, who was present with the expedition which founded the colony, Raffles, after consultation with Lord Hastings, was about to establish a settlement for the protection and encouragement of our Eastern trade, in the Nicobar Islands, when his attention was drawn to the superior advantages of Singapore by Captains Ross and Crawford of the Bombay Marine, who had been engaged in the survey of those seas. Its great adaptation for a mercantile settlement had been discerned by the shrewd, if somewhat vulgar, Scot, Alexander Hamilton, 120 years earlier. It seems hardly possible, we must however observe, to reconcile the details in the article cited, with the letters and facts contained in the Life of Raffles; though probably the latter had, at some time or other, received information from the officers named by Mr. Ritchie.\n 1512. -- \"And as the enterprise was one to make good booty, everybody was delighted to go on it, so that they were more than 1200 men, the soundest and best armed of the garrison, and so they were ready incontinently, and started for the Strait of Cincapura, where they were to wait for the junks.\" -- Correa, ii. 284-5.\n 1551. -- \"Sed hactenus Deus nobis adsit omnibus.

This is the name now applied distinctively to that outer range of tertiary hills which in various parts of the Him\u0101laya runs parallel to the foot of the mountain region, separated from it by valleys known in Upper India as d\u016bns (see DHOON). But this special and convenient sense (d) has been attributed to the term by modern Anglo-Indian geographers only. Among the older Mahommedan historians the term Siw\u0101likh is applied to a territory to the west of and perhaps embracing the Aravalli Hills, but certainly including specifically Nagore (N\u0101gaur) and Mand\u0101war the predecessor of modern Jodhp\u016br, and in the vicinity of that city. This application is denoted by (a).\n In one or two passages we find the application of the name (Siw\u0101likh) extending a good deal further south, as if reaching to the vicinity of M\u0101lw\u0101. Such instances we have grouped under (b). But it is possible that the early application (a) habitually extended thus far.\n At a later date the name is applied to the Him\u0101laya; either to the range in its whole extent, as in the passages from Chereffedin (Shar\u012bffudd\u012bn 'Ali of Yezd) and from Baber; sometimes with a possible limitation to that part of the mountains which overlooks the Punjab; or, as the quotation from Rennell indicates, with a distinction between the less lofty region nearest the plains, and the Alpine summits beyond, Siw\u0101lik applying to the former only.\n The true Indian form of the name is, we doubt not, to be gathered from the occurrence, in a list of Indian national names, in the Vishnu Pur\u0101na, of the Saiv\u0101las. But of the position of these we can only say that the nations, with whom the context immediately associates them, seem to lie towards the western part of Upper India. (See Wilson's Works, Vishnu Pur\u0101na, ii. 175.) The popular derivation of Siw\u0101lik as given in several of the quotations below, is from sawal\u0101kh, 'One l\u0101kh and a quarter'; but this is of no more value than most popular etymologies.\n We give numerous quotations to establish the old application of the term, because this has been somewhat confused in Elliot's extracts by the interpolated phrase 'Siw\u00e1lik Hills,' where it is evident from Raverty's version of the \u1e6cabak\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b that there is no such word as Hills in the original.\n We have said that the special application of the term to the detached sub-Him\u0101layan range is quite modern. It seems in fact due to that very eminent investigator in many branches of natural science, Dr. Hugh Falconer; at least we can find no trace of it before the use of the term by him in papers presented to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. It is not previously used, so far as we can discover, even by Royle; nor is it known to Jacquemont, who was intimately associated with Royle and Cautley, at Sah\u0101ranp\u016br, very shortly before Falconer's arrival there. Jacquemont (Journal, ii. 11) calls the range: \"la premi\u00e8re chaine de montagnes que j'appellerai les montagnes de Dehra.\" The first occurrence that we can find is in a paper by Falconer on the 'Aptitude of the Him\u0101layan Range for the Culture of the Tea Plant,' in vol. iii. of the J. As. Soc. Bengal, which we quote below. A year later, in the account of the Sivatherium fossil, by Falconer and Cautley, in the As. Researches, we have a fuller explanation of the use of the term Siw\u0101lik, and its alleged etymology.\n It is probable that there may have been some real legendary connection of the hills in the vicinity with the name of \u015aiva. For in some of the old maps, such as that in Bernier's Travels, we find Siba given as the name of a province about Hurdw\u0101r; and the same name occurs in the same connection in the Mem. of the Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br (Elliot, vi. 382).

In the usual way of transferring names which belong to other regions, this name is sometimes applied in S. India to the Lemur (Loris gracilis, Jerdon).\n", "snake-stone": "s. This is a term applied to a substance, the application of which to the part where a snake-bite has taken effect, is supposed to draw out the poison and render it innocuous. Such applications are made in various parts of the Old and New Worlds. The substances which have this reputation are usually of a porous kind, and when they have been chemically examined have proved to be made of charred bone, or the like. There is an article in the 13th vol. of the Asiatic Researches by Dr. J. Davy, entitled An Analysis of the Snake-Stone, in which the results of the examination of three different kinds, all obtained from Sir Alex. Johnstone, Chief Justice of Ceylon, is given. (1) The first kind was of round or oval form, black or brown in the middle, white towards the circumference, polished and somewhat lustrous, and pretty enough to be sometimes worn as a neck ornament; easily cut with a knife, but not scratched by the nail. When breathed on it emitted an earthy smell, and when applied to the tongue, or other moist surface, it adhered firmly. This kind proved to be of bone partially calcined. (2) We give below a quotation regarding the second kind. (3) The third was apparently a bezoar, (q.v.), rather than a snake-stone. There is another article in the As. Res. xvi. 382 seqq. by Captain J. D. Herbert, on Zehr Mohereh, or Snake-Stone. Two kinds are described which were sold under the name given (Zahr muhra, where zahr is 'poison,' muhra, 'a kind of polished shell,' 'a bead,' applied to a species of bezoar).

The Indians report that it is bred in the head of certain Serpents. But I rather take it to be a story of the Idoloter's Priests, and that the Stone is rather a composition of certain Drugs. . . . If the Person bit be not much wounded, the place must be incis'd; and the Stone being appli'd thereto, will not fall off till it has drawn all the poison to it: To cleanse it you must steep it in Womans-milk, or for want of that, in Cows-milk. . . . There are two ways to try whether the Serpent-stone be true or false. The first is, by putting the Stone in your mouth, for there it will give a leap, and fix to the Palate. The other is by putting it in a glass full of water; for if the Stone be true, the water will fall a boyling, and rise in little bubbles. . . .\"- Tavernier, E.T., Pt. ii. 155; [ed. Ball, ii. 152].

Properly Sant\u0101ls, [the name being said to come from a place called Saont, now Silda in Mednipur, where the tribe remained for a long time (Dalton, Descr. Eth. 210-11)]. The name of a non-Aryan people belonging to the Kolarian class, extensively settled in the hilly country to the west of the Hoogly R. and to the south of Bh\u0101galpur, from which they extended to Balasore at interval, sometimes in considerable masses, but more generally much scattered. The territory in which they are chiefly settled is now formed into a separate district called Sant\u0101l Parganas, and sometimes Santalia. Their settlement in this tract is, however, quite modern; they have emigrated thither from the S.W. In Dr. F. Buchanan's statistical account of Bh\u0101galpur and its Hill people the Sant\u0101ls are not mentioned. The earliest mention of this tribe that we have found is in Mr. Sutherland's Report on the Hill People, which is printed in the Appendix to Long.

The Regulation Courts, with their horde of leeches in the shape of badly paid, and corrupt Amlah (Omlah) and pettifogging Mooktears, were abolished, and in their place a Number of active English gentlemen, termed Assistant Commissioners, and nominated by Mr. Yule, were set down among the Sonthals, with a Code of Regulations drawn up by that gentleman, the pith of which may be summed up as follows:-\n \"'To have no medium between the Sonthal and the Hakim, i.e. Assistant Commissioner. \n \"'To patiently hear any complaint made by the Sonthal from his own mouth, without any written petition or charge whatever, and without any Amlah or Court at the time.\n \"'To carry out all criminal work by the aid of the villagers themselves, who were to bring in the accused, with the witnesses, to the Hakim, who should immediately attend to their statements, and punish them, if found guilty, according to the tenor of the law.'\n \"These were some of the most important of the golden rules carried out by men who recognised the responsibility of their situation; and with an adored chief, in the shape of Yule, for their ruler, whose firm, judicious, and gentlemanly conduct made them work with willing hearts, their endeavours were crowned with a success which far exceeded the expectations of the most sanguine. . . .\" -- Sonthalia and the Sonthals, by E.

Arts, 246) defines s\u016bs\u012bs as \"fine-coloured cloths, made chiefly at Battala and Sialkote, striped in the direction of the warp with silk, or cotton lines of a different colour, the cloth being called dokanni [dokh\u0101n\u012b], 'in two stripes' if the stripe has two lines, if three, tinkanni [t\u012bnkh\u0101n\u012b], and so on.\" In the Punjab it is 'a striped stuff used for women's trousers. This is made of fine thread, and is one of the fabrics in which English thread is now largely used' (Francis, Mon. on Cotton Manufactures, 7). A silk fabric of the same name is made in the N.W.P., where it is classed as a variety of ch\u0101rkh\u0101na, or check (Yusuf Ali, Mon. on Silk, 93). Forbes Watson (Textile Manufactures, 85) speaks of Sousee as chiefly employed for trousering, being a mixture of cotton and silk. The word seems to derive its origin from Susa, the Biblical Shushan, the capital of Susiana or Elam, and from the time of Darius I. the chief residence of the Achaemenian kings. There is ample evidence to show that fabrics from Babylon were largely exported in early times. Such was perhaps the \"Babylonish garment\" found at Ai (Josh. vii. 21), which the R.V. marg. translates as a \"mantle of Shinar\"). This a writer in Smith's Dict. of the Bible calls \"robes trimmed with valuable furs, or the skins themselves ornamented with embroidery\" (i. 452). These Babylonian fabrics have been often described (see Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, 537; Maspero, Dawn of Civ., 470, 758; Encycl. Bibl. ii. 1286 seq.; Frazer, Pausanias, iii. 545 seq.). An early reference to this old trade in costly cloths will be found in the quotation from the Periplus under CHINA, which has been discussed by Sir H. Yule (Introd. to Gill, River of Golden Sand, ed. 1883, p. 88 seq.). This S\u016bs\u012b cloth appears in a log of 1746 as Soacie, and was known to the Portuguese in 1550 as Soajes (J. R. As.

The first king of the family was Isma'il, claiming descent from 'Ali and the Im\u0101ms, through a long line of persons of saintly reputation at Ardebil. The surname of S\u016bf\u012b or Saf\u012b assumed by Isma'il is generally supposed to have been taken from Shaikh Saf\u012b-ud-d\u012bn, the first of his more recent ancestors to become famous, and who belonged to the class of S\u016bf\u012bs or philosophic devotees.

Of this monosyllable only the so represents the classical siyau; the final consonant (y) is a relic of the termination yu.

Pers. sakall\u0101t, sakallat, saklat\u012bn,sakl\u0101t\u016bn, applied to certain woollen stuffs, and particularly now to European broadcloth. It is sometimes defined as scarlet broad cloth; but though this colour is frequent, it does not seem to be essential to the name. [Scarlet was the name of a material long before it denoted a colour. In the Liberate Roll of 14 Hen. III. (1230, quoted in N. & Q. 8 ser. i. 129) we read of sanguine scarlet, brown, red, white and scarlet coloris de Marble.] It has, however, been supposed that our word scarlet comes from some form of the present word (see Skeat, s.v. Scarlet).* But the fact that the Arab. dictionaries give a form sakirl\u0101t must not be trusted to. It is a modern form, probably taken from the European word, [as according to Skeat, the Turkish iskerlat is merely borrowed from the Ital. scarlatto].\n The word is found in the medieval literature of Europe in the form sicla- Here is an instance in which scarlet is used for 'scarlet broadcloth':\n c. 1665. -- \". . . they laid them out, partly in fine Cotton Cloth . . . partly in Silken Stuffs streaked with Gold and Silver, to make Vests and Summer-Drawers of; partly in English Scarlet, to make two Arabian Vests of for their King . . .\"- Bernier, E.T. 43; [ed. Constable, 139].\n toun, a term which has been the subject of controversy both as to etymology and to exact meaning (see Marco Polo, Bk. i. ch. 58, notes). Among the conjectures as to etymology are a derivation from Ar. sakl. 'polishing' (see SICLEEGUR); from Sicily (Ar. Sikiliya); and from the Lat. cyclas, cycladatus. In the Arabic Vocabulista of the 13th century (Florence, 1871), siklat\u016bn is translated by ciclas. The conclusion come to in the note on Marco Polo, based, partly but not entirely, on the modern meaning of sakall\u0101t, was that sakl\u0101t\u016bn was probably a light woollen texture. But Dozy and De Jong give it as \u00e9toffe de soie, broch\u00e9e d'or, and the passage from Edrisi supports this undoubtedly.

Literally 'chief,' being Ar. sadr. This term had a technical application under Mahommedan rule to a chief Judge, as in the example quoted below. The use of the word seems to be almost confined to the Bengal Presidency. Its principal applications are the following:\n a. Sudder Board.

It is shaped, but not much distorted, by the existence in Hind. of the Ar. word saf\u012bna for 'a blank-book, a note-book.'\n", "sugar": "s. This familiar word is of Skt. origin. Sarkara originally signifies 'grit or gravel,' thence crystallised sugar, and through a Prakrit form sakkara gave the Pers. shakkar, the Greek SA/KXAR and SA/KXARON, and the late Latin saccharum. The Ar. is sukkar, or with the article as-sukkar, and it is probable that our modern forms, It. zucchero and succhero, Fr. sucre, Germ. Zucker, Eng. sugar, came as well as the Sp. azucar, and Port. assucar, from the Arabic direct, and not through Latin or Greek. The Russian is sakhar; Polish zukier; Hung. zukur. In fact the ancient knowledge of the product was slight and vague, and it was by the Arabs that the cultivation of the sugar-cane was introduced into Egypt, Sicily, and Andalusia. It is possible indeed, and not improbable, that palm-sugar (see JAGGERY) is a much older product than that of the cane. [This is disputed by Watt (Econ. Dict. vi. pt. i. p. 31), who is inclined to fix the home of the cane in E. India.] The original habitat of the cane is not known; there is only a slight and doubtful statement of Loureiro, who, in speaking of Cochin-China, uses the words \"habitat et colitur,\" which may imply its existence in a wild state, as well as under cultivation, in that country. De Candolle assigns its earliest production to the country extending from Cochin-China to Bengal.\n Though, as we have said, the knowledge which the ancients had of sugar was very dim, we are disposed greatly to question the thesis, which has been so confidently maintained by Salmasius and later writers, that the original saccharon of Greek and Roman writers was not sugar but the siliceous concretion sometimes deposited in bamboos, and used in medieval medicine under the name tabasheer (q.v.) (where see a quotation from Royle, taking the same view). It is just possible that Pliny in the passage quoted below may have jumbled up two different things, but we see no sufficient evidence even of this. In White's Latin Dict. we read that by the word saccharon is meant (not sugar but) \"a sweet juice distilling from the joints of the bamboo.\" This is nonsense. There is no such sweet juice distilled from the joints of the bamboo; nor is the substance tabash\u012br at all sweet. On the contrary it is slightly bitter and physicky in taste, with no approach to sweetness. It is a hydrate of silica. It could never have been called \"honey\" (see Dioscorides and Pliny below); and the name of bamboo-sugar appears to have been given it by the Arabs merely because of some resemblance of its concretions to lumps of sugar. [The same view is taken in the Encycl. Brit. 9th ed. xxii. 625, quoting Not. et Extr., xxv. 267.] All the erroneous notices of SA/KXARON seem to be easily accounted for by lack of knowledge; and they are exactly paralleled by the loose and inaccurate stories about the origin of camphor, of lac, and what-not, that may be found within the boards of this book.\n In the absence or scarcity of sugar, honey was the type of sweetness, and hence the name of honey applied to sugar in several of these early extracts. This phraseology continued down to the Middle Ages, at least in its application to uncrystallised products of the sugar-cane, and analogous substances. In the quotation from Pegolotti we apprehend that his three kinds of honey indicate honey, treacle, and a syrup or treacle made from the sweet pods of the carob-tree.\n Sugar does not seem to have been in early Chinese use. The old Chinese books often mention shi-mi or 'stonehoney' as a product of India and Persia. In the reign of Taitsung (627-650) a man was sent to Gangetic India to learn the art of sugar-making; and Marco Polo below mentions the introduction from Egypt of the further art of refining it. In India now, Ch\u012bn\u012b (Cheeny) (Chinese) is applied to the whiter kinds of common sugar; Misr\u012b (Misree) or Egyptian, to sugar-candy; loaf-sugar is called kand.\n c.

The western and most mountainous part of the island of Java, in which a language different from the proper Javanese is spoken, and the people have many differences of manners, indicating distinction of race. In the 16th century, Java and Sunda being often distinguished, a common impression grew up that they were separate islands; and they are so represented in some maps of the 16th century, just as some medieval maps, including that of Fra Mauro (1459), show a like separation between England and Scotland. The name Sunda is more properly indeed that of the people than of their country. The Dutch call them Sundanese (Soendanezen). The Sunda country is considered to extend from the extreme western point of the island to Cheribon, i.e. embracing about onethird of the whole island of Java. Hinduism appears to have prevailed in the Sunda country, and held its ground longer than in \"Java,\" a name which the proper Javanese restrict to their own part of the island. From this country the sea between Sumatra and Java got from Europeans the name of the Straits of Sunda. Geographers have also called the great chain of islands from Sumatra to Timor \"the Sunda Islands.\"\n [Mr. Whiteway adds: \"There was another Sunda near Goa, but above the Gh\u0101ts, where an offspring of the Vij\u0101yanagara family ruled.

The well-known name of the tract of intersecting creeks and channels, swampy islands, and jungles, which constitutes that part of the Ganges Delta nearest the sea. The limits of the region so-called are the mouth of the Hoogly on the west, and that of the Megna (i.e. of the combined great Ganges and Brahmaputra) on the east, a width of about 220 miles. The name appears not to have been traced in old native documents of any kind, and hence its real form and etymology remain uncertain. Sundara-vana, 'beautiful forest'; Sundar\u012b-vana, or -ban, 'forest of the Sundar\u012b tree'; Chandra-ban, and Chandra-band, 'moon-forest' or 'moonembankment'; Chanda-bhanda, the name of an old tribe of salt-makers;\u2021 Chandra d\u012bp-ban from a large zemindary called Chandra-d\u012bp in the Bakerganj district at the eastern extremity of the Sunderbunds; these are all suggestions that have been made. Whatever be the true etymology, we doubt if it is to be sought in sundara or sundar\u012b. [As to the derivation from the Sundar\u012b tree which is perhaps most usually Apparently 30,000 quintals every two years.\n Sunda Kalapa was the same as Jacatra, on the site of which the Dutch founded Batavia in 1619.\n These are mentioned in a copper tablet inscription of A.D. 1136; see Blochmann, as quoted further on, p. 226.\n accepted, Mr. Beveridge (Man. of Bakarganj, 24, 167, 32) remarks that this tree is by no means common in many parts of the Bakarganj Sunderbunds; he suggests that the word means 'beautiful wood' and was possibly given by the Brahmans.] The name has never (except in one quotation below) been in English mouths, or in English popular orthography, Soonderbunds, but Sunderbunds, which implies (in correct transliteration) an original sandra or chandra, not sundara. And going back to what we conjecture may be an early occurrence of the name in two Dutch writers, we find this confirmed. These two writers, it will be seen, both speak of a famous Sandery, or Santry, Forest in Lower Bengal, and we should be more positive in our identification were it not that in Van der Broucke's map (1660) which was published in Valentijn's East Indies (1726) this Sandery Forest is shown on the west side of the Hoogly R., in fact about due west of the site of Calcutta, and a little above a place marked as Basanderi, located near the exit into the Hoogly of what represents the old Saraswati R., which enters the former at S\u0101nkr\u0101l, not far below the Botanical Gardens, and 5 or 6 miles below Fort William. This has led Mr. Blochmann to identify the Sanderi Bosch with the old Mahall Basandhari which appears in the \u0100\u012bn as belonging to the Sirk\u0101r of Sul\u012bm\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d (Gladwin's Ayeen, ii. 207, orig. i. 407; Jarrett, ii. 140; Blochm. in J.A.S.B. xlii. pt. i. p. 232), and which formed one of the original \"xxiv. Pergunnas.\"* Undoubtedly this is the Basanderi of V. den Broucke's map; but it seems possible that some confusion between Basanderi and Bosch Sandery (which would be Sandarban in the vernacular) may have led the map-maker to misplace the latter. We should gather from Schulz\u2020 that he passed the Forest of Sandry about a Dutch mile below Sankral, which he mentions. But his statement is so nearly identical with that in Valentijn that we appre Basandhari is also mentioned by Mr. James Grant (1786) in his View of the Revenues of Bengal, as the Pergunna of Belia-bussendry; and by A. Hamilton as a place on the Dam\u016bdar, producing much good sugar (Fifth Report, p. 405; A. Ham. ii.4). It would seem to have been the present Pergunna of Balia, some 13 or 14 miles west of the northern part of Calcutta.

III. c. 63), and afterwards at the other two Presidencies. Its extent of jurisdiction was the subject of acrimonious controversies in the early years of its existence; controversies which were closed by 21 Geo. III. c. 70, which explained and defined the jurisdiction of the Court. The use of the name came to an end in 1862 with the establishment of the 'High Court,' the bench of which is occupied by barrister judges, judges from the Civil Service, and judges promoted from the native bar.\n The Charter of Charles II., of 1661, gave the Company certain powers to administer the laws of England, and that of 1683 to establish Courts of Judicature. That of Geo. I. (1726) gave power to establish at each Presidency Mayor's Courts for civil suits, with appeal to the Governor and Council, and from these, in cases involving more than 1000 pagodas, to the King in Council. The same charter constituted the Governor and Council of each Presidency a Court for trial of all offences except high treason. Courts of Requests were established by charter of Geo. II., 1753. The Mayor's Court at Madras and Bombay survived till 1797, when (by 37 Geo. III. ch. 142) a Recorder's Court was instituted at each. This was superseded at Madras by a Supreme Court in 1801, and at Bombay in 1823.\n", "sura": "s. Toddy (q.v.), i.e. the fermented sap of several kinds of palm, such as coco, palmyra, and wilddate. It is the Skt. sura, 'vinous liquor,' which has passed into most of the vernaculars. In the first quotation we certainly have the word, though combined with other elements of uncertain identity, applied by Cosmas to the milk of the coco-nut, perhaps making some confusion between that and the fermented sap. It will be seen that Linschoten applies supra in the same way. Bluteau, curiously, calls this a Caffre word. It has in fact been introduced from India into Africa by the Portuguese (see Ann.

In English use the name of this city is accented Sur\u00e1tt; but the name is in native writing and parlance generally S\u016dr\u0103t. In the \u0100\u012bn, however (see below), it is written S\u016brat; *(ROGXO\\ perhaps is Tam. lanha, 'coco-nut.'\n also in \u1e63\u0101di\u1e33 Isfah\u0101n\u012b (p. 106). Surat was taken by Akbar in 1573, having till then remained a part of the falling Mahommedan kingdom of Guzerat. An English factory was first established in 1608-9, which was for more than half a century the chief settlement of the English Company in Continental India. The transfer of the Chiefs to Bombay took place in 1687.\n We do not know the origin of the name. Various legends on the subject are given in Mr. (now Sir J.) Campbell's Bombay Gazetteer (vol. ii.), but none of them have any probability. The ancient Indian Saur\u0101shtra was the name of the Peninsula of Guzerat or Kattywar, or at least of the maritime part of it. This latter name and country is represented by the differently spelt and pronounced So\u0304rath (see SURATH). Sir Henry Elliot and his editor have repeatedly stated the opinion that the names are identical. Thus: \"The names 'Surat' and 'S\u016brath' are identical, both being derived from the Sankrit Sur\u00e1shtra; but as they belong to different places a distinction in spelling has been maintained. 'Surat' is the city; 'S\u00farath' is a pr\u00e1nt or district of Kattiwar, of which Jun\u00e1garh is the chief town\" (Elliot, v. 350; see also 197). Also: \"The Sanskrit Sur\u00e1shtra and Gurjjara survive in the modern names Surat and Guzerat, and however the territories embraced by the old terms have varied, it is hard to conceive that Surat was not in Sur\u00e1shtra nor Guzerat in Gurjjara. All evidence goes to prove that the old and modern names applied to the same places. Thus Ptolemy's Surastrene comprises Surat. . . .\" (Dowson (?) ibid. i. 359). This last statement seems distinctly erroneous. Surat is in Ptolemy's *LA/RIKH, not in *SURASTRHNH/, which represents, like Saur\u0101shtra, the peninsula. It must remain doubtful whether there was any connection between the names, or the resemblance was accidental. It is possible that continental Surat may have originally had some name implying its being the place of passage to Saur\u0101shtra or Sorath.\n Surat is not a place of any antiquity. There are some traces of the existence of the name ascribed to the 14th century, in passages of uncertain value in certain native writers. But it only came to notice as a place of any importance about the very end of the 15th century, when a rich Hindu trader, Gopi by name, is stated to have established himself on the spot, and founded the town. The way, however, in which it is spoken of by Barbosa previous to 1516 shows that the rise of its prosperity must have been rapid.\n [Surat in English slang is equivalent to the French Rafiot, in the sense of 'no great shakes,' an adulterated article of inferior quality (Barr\u00e9re, s.v. Rafiot). This perhaps was accounted for by the fact that \"until lately the character of Indian cotton in the Liverpool market stood very low, and the name 'Surats,' the description under which the cotton of this province is still included, was a byword and a general term of contempt\" (Berar Gazetteer, 226 seq.).]\n 1510. -- \"Don Afonso\" (de Noronha, nephew of Alboquerque) \"in the storm not knowing whither they went, entered the Gulf of Cambay, and struck upon a shoal in front of \u00c7urrate.

The rite of widowburning; i.e. the burning of the living widow along with the corpse of her husband, as practised by people of certain castes among the Hindus, and eminently by the R\u0101jp\u016bts.\n The word is properly Skt. sat\u012b, 'a good woman,' 'a true wife,' and thence specially applied, in modern vernaculars of Sanskrit parentage, to the wife who was considered to accomplish the supreme act of fidelity by sacrificing herself on the funeral pile of her husband. The application of this substantive to the suicidal act, instead of the person, is European. The proper Skt. term for the act is sahagamana, or 'keeping company,' [sahamara\u1e47a, 'dying together'].* A very long series of quotations in illustration of the practice, from classical times downwards, might be given. We shall present a selection.\n We should remark that the word (sat\u012b or suttee) does not occur, so far as we know, in any European work older than the 17th century. And then it only occurs in a disguised form (see quotation from P. Della Valle). The term masti which he uses is probably mah\u0101-sat\u012b, which occurs in Skt. Dictionaries ('a wife of great virtue'). Della Valle is usually eminent in the correctness of his transcriptions of Oriental words. This conjecture of the interpretation of masti is confirmed, and the traveller himself justified, by an entry in Mr. Whitworth's Dictionary of a word Masti-kalla used in Canara for a monument commemorating a sati. Kalla is stone and masti=mah\u0101-sat\u012b. We have not found the term exactly in any European document older than Sir C. Malet's letter of 1787, and Sir W. Jones's of the same year (see below).\n Suttee is a Brahmanical rite, and there is a Sanskrit ritual in existence (see Classified Index to the Tanjore MSS., p. 135a). It was introduced into Southern India with the Brahman civilisation, and was prevalent there chiefly in the Brahmanical Kingdom of Vijayanagar, and among the Mahrattas. In Malabar, the most primitive part But it is worthy of note that in the Island of Bali one manner of accomplishing the rite is called Satia (Skt. saty\u0101, 'truth,' from sat, whence also sat\u012b). See Crawfurd, H. of Ind. Archip. ii. 243, and Friedrich, in Verhandelingen van het Batav. Genootschap. xxiii. 10.\n of S. India, the rite is forbidden (An\u0101ch\u0101ranir\u1e47aya, v. 26). The cases mentioned by Teixeira below, and in the Lettres \u00c9difiantes, occurred at Tanjore and Madura. A (Mahratta) Brahman at Tanjore told one of the present writers that he had to perform commemorative funeral rites for his grandfather and grandmother on the same day, and this indicated that his grandmother had been a sat\u012b.\n The practice has prevailed in various regions besides India. Thus it seems to have been an early custom among the heathen Russians, or at least among nations on the Volga called Russians by Ma\u1e63'\u016bd\u012b and Ibn Fo\u1e93l\u0101n. Herodotus (Bk. v. ch. 5) describes it among certain tribes of Thracians. It was in vogue in Tonga and the Fiji Islands. It has prevailed in the island of Bali within our own tiine, though there accompanying Hindu rites, and perhaps of Hindu origin, -- certainly modified by Hindu influence. A full account of Suttee as practised in those Malay Islands will be found in Zollinger's account of the Religion of Sassak in J. Ind. Arch. ii. 166; also see Friedrich's Bali as in note preceding. [A large number of references to Suttee are collected in Frazer, Pausanias, iii. 198 seqq.]\n In Diodorus we have a long account of the rivalry as to which of the two wives of K\u0113teus, a leader of the Indian contingent in the army of Eumenes, should perform suttee. One is rejected as with child. The history of the other terminates thus:\n B.C. 317. -- \"Finally, having taken leave of those of the household, she was set upon the pyre by her own brother, and was regarded with wonder by the crowd that had run together to the spectacle, and heroically ended her life; the whole force with their arms thrice marching round the pyre before it was kindled. But she, laying herself beside her husband, and even at the violence of the flame giving utterance to no unbecoming cry, stirred pity indeed in others of the spectators, and in some excess of eulogy; not but what there were some of the Greeks present who reprobated such rites as barbarous and cruel. . . .\" -- Diod.

Candish, in Hakl. iv. 338. This passage refers to Blambangan at the east end of Java, which till a late date was subject to Bali, in which such practices have continued to our day. It seems probable that the Hindu rite here came in contact with the old Polynesian practices of a like kind, which prevailed e.g. in Fiji, quite recently. The narrative referred to below under 1633, where the victims were the slaves of a deceased queen, points to the latter origin. W. Humboldt thus alludes to similar passages in old Javanese literature: \"Thus we may reckon as one of the finest episodes in the Brata Yuda, the story how Satya Wati, when she had sought out her slain husband among the wide-spread heap of corpses on the battlefield, stabs herself by his side with a dagger.\" -- Kawi-Sprache, i. 89 (and see the whole section, pp. 87-95).\n [c. 1590. -- \"When he (the Rajah of Asham) dies, his principal attendants of both sexes voluntarily bury themselves alive in his grave.\" -- \u0100\u012bn, ed.

The root of Batatas edulis, Choisy (ConvolvulusBatatas, L.), N.O. Convolvulaceae; a very palatable vegetable, grown in most parts of India. Though extensively cultivated in America, and in the W. Indies, it has been alleged in various books (e.g. in Eng. Cyclop. Nat. Hist. Section, and in Drury's Useful Plants of India), that the plant is a native of the Malay islands. The Eng. Cyc. even states that batatas is the Malay name. But the whole allegation is probably founded in error. The Malay names of the plant, as given by Crawfurd, are Kaledek, Ubi Jawa, and Ubi Kastila, the last two names meaning 'Java yam,' and 'Spanish yam,' and indicating the foreign origin of the vegetable. In India, at least in the Bengal Presidency, natives commonly call it shakarkand, P. -- Ar., literally 'sugar-candy,' a name equally suggesting that it is not indigenous among them. And in fact when we turn to Oviedo, we find the following distinct statement:\n \"Batatas are a staple food of the Indians, both in the Island of Spagnuola and in the others . . . and a ripe Batata properly dressed is just as good as a marchpane twist of sugar and almonds, and better indeed. . . . When Batatas are well ripened, they are often carried to Spain, i.e., if the voyage be a quiet one; for if there be delay they get spoilt at sea. I myself have carried them from this city of S. Domingo to the city of Avila in Spain, and although they did not arrive as good as they should be, yet they were thought a great deal of, and reckoned a singular and precious kind of fruit.\" -- In Ramusio, iii. f. 134.\n It must be observed however that several distinct varieties are cultivated by the Pacific islanders even as far west as New Zealand. And Dr. Bretschneider is satisfied that the plant is described in Chinese books of the 3rd or 4th century, under the name of Kan-chu (the first syllable ='sweet'). See B. on Chin. Botan. Words, p. 13. This is the only good argument we have seen for Asiatic origin. The whole matter is carefully dealt with by M. Alph. De Candolle (Origine des Plantes cultiv\u00e9es, pp. 43-45), concluding with the judgment: \"Les motifs sont beaucoup plus forts, ce me semble, en faveur de l'origine americaine. \"\n The \"Sanskrit name\" Ruktaloo, alleged by Mr. Piddington, is worthless. \u0100l\u016b is properly an esculent Arum, but in modern use is the name of the common potato, and is sometimes used for the sweet potato. Rakt\u0101l\u016b, more commonly rat-\u0101l\u016b, is in Bengal the usual name of the Yam, no doubt given first to a highly-coloured kind, such as Dioscorea purpurea, for rakt- or rat-\u0101l\u016b means simply 'red potato'; a name which might also be well applied to the batatas, as it is indeed, according to Forbes Watson, in the Deccan. There can be little doubt that this vegetable, or fruit as Oviedo calls it, having become known in Europe many years before the potato, the latter robbed it of its name, as has happened in the case of brazil- wood (q.v.). The batata is clearly the 'potato' of the fourth and others of the following quotations. [See Watt, Econ. Dict. iii. 117 seqq.]\n 1519. -- \"At this place (in Brazil) we had refreshment of victuals, like fowls and meat of calves, also a variety of fruits, called batate, pigne (pine-apples), sweet, of singular goodness. . . .\" -- Pigafetta, E.T. by Lord Stanley of A., p. 43.\n 1540. -- \"The root which among the Indians of Spagnuola Island is called Batata, the negroes of St. Thom\u00e8 (C.
