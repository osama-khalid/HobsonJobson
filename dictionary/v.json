An idol temple is r\u016bmah-bar\u0101hl\u0101, 'a house of idols,' but bar\u0101hl\u0101 alone may have been used elliptically by the Malays or misunderstood by the Portuguese.

Thus in Linschoten's description of the route from Malacca to Macao, he mentions at the entrance to the 'Straits of Sincapura,' a rock having the appearance of an obelisk, called the Varella del China; and again, on the eastern coast of Champa, or Cochin China, we have frequent notice of a point (with a river also) called that of the Varella. Thus in Pinto:\n 1540. -- \"The Friday following we found ourselves just against a River called by the inhabitants of the Country Tinacoreu, and by us (the) Varella.\" -- Pinto (in Cogan), p. 48.\n This Varella of Champa is also mentioned by Linschoten:\n 1598. -- \". . . from this thirde point to the Varella the coast turneth North. . . .

Of these books there are nominally four, viz. the Rig, Yajur, S\u0101ma and Atharva Vedas.\n The earliest direct intimation of knowledge of the existence of the Vedas appears to be in the book called De Tribus Impostoribus, said to have been printed in 1598, in which they are mentioned.\u2020 Possibly this know Compare this vivid description with a modern notice of the same pagoda:\n 1855. \"This meridian range . . . 700 miles from its origin in the Naga wilds . . . sinks in the sea hard by Negrais, its last bluff crowned by the golden Pagoda of Modain, gleaming far to seaward, a Burmese Sunium.\" -- Yule, Mission to Ava, 272.

Also see 7 Ser. N. &. Q. viii. 449 seqq.; 9 Ser. ix. 55. The passage about the Vedas seems to be the following: \"Et Sectarii istorum, ut et Vedae et Brachmanorum ante MCCC retro secula obstant collectanea, ut de Sinensibus nil dicam. Tu, qui in angulo Europae hic delitescis, ista neglegis, negas; quam bene videas ipse. Eadem facilitate enim isti tua negant. Et quid non miraculorum superesset ad convincendos orbis incolas, si mundum ex Scorpionis ovo conditum et progenitum terramque Tauri capiti impositam, et rerum prima fundamentis ex prioribus III. Vedae libris constarent, nisi invidus aliquis Deorum filius haec III. prima volumina furatus esset!\"]\n ledge came through the Arabs. Though thus we do not trace back any direct allusion to the Vedas in European books, beyond the year 1600 or thereabouts, there seems good reason to believe that the Jesuit missionaries had information on the subject at a much earlier date. St. Francis Xavier had frequent discussions with Brahmans, and one went so far as to communicate to him the mantra \"Om \u015br\u012bn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47an\u0101mah.\" In 1559 a learned Brahman at Goa was converted by Father Belchior Carneyro, and baptized by the name of Manuel. He afterwards (with the Viceroy's sanction!) went by night and robbed a Brahman on the mainland who had collected many MSS., and presented the spoil to the Fathers, with great satisfaction to himself and them (Sousa, Orient. Conquist.  i. 151-2).\n It is probable that the information concerning the Hindu religion and sacred books which was attained even in Europe by the end of the 16th century was greater than is commonly supposed, and greater than what we find in print would warrant us to assume. A quotation from San Roman below illustrates this in a general way. And in a constitution of Gregory XV. dated January 31, 1623, there is mention of rites called Haiteres and Tandi\u00e9, which doubtless represent the Vedic names Aitareya and T\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya (see Norbert, i. 39). Lucena's allusion below to the \"four parts\" of Hindu doctrine must have reference to the Vedas, and his information must have come from reports and letters, as he never was in India. In course of time, however, what had been known seems to have been forgotten, and even Halhed (1776) could write about 'Beids of the Shaster!' (see Code, p. xiii.). This shows that though he speaks also of the 'Four Beids' (p. xxxi.) he had no precise knowledge.\n In several of the earlier quotations of the word it will be seen that the form used is Vedam or Veidam. This is the Tamil form. And it became prevalent during the 18th century in France from Voltaire's having con stituted himself the advocate of a Sanskrit Poem, called by him l'Ezour Vedam, and which had its origin in S. India. This was in reality an imitation of an Indian Pur\u0101na, composed by some missionary in the 17th century (probably by R. de' Nobili), to introduce Christian doctrines; but Voltaire supposed it to be really an ancient Indian book. Its real character was first explained by Sonnerat (see the Essay by F. W. Ellis, in As. Res. xi.). The first information regarding the real Vedas was given by Colebrooke in 1805 (As. Res. viii.). Orme and some authors of the 18th and early part of the 19th century write Bede, which represents the N. Indian vernacular form Bed. Both forms, Bed and Vedam, are known to Fleury, as we see below.\n On the subject of the Vedas, see Weber's Hist. of Indian Lit., Max M\u00fcller's Ancient Sanskrit Lit., Whitney's Oriental and Linguistic Studies, vol. i.

Defr\u00e9m\u00e9ry, in Revue Critique, 1869, 1st Sem. p. 64.\n Plausible as this is, it may be rejected. Is it not, however, possible that bar\u0101mada, the literal meaning of which is 'coming forward, projecting,' may be a Persian 'striving after meaning,' in explanation of the foreign word which they may have borrowed?\n Williams, again, in his Skt. Dict. (1872) gives 'vara\u1e47\u1e0da . . . a veranda, a portico. . . .' Moreover Beames in his Comparative Grammar of Modern Aryan Languages, gives Sansk. bara\u1e47\u1e0da, 'portico,' Bengali b\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Hind. vara\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, adding: \"Most of our wiseacre literateurs (qu. litt\u00e9rateurs ?) in Hindustan now-a-days consider this word to be derived from Pers. bar\u0101madah, and write it accordingly. It is, however, good Sanskrit\" (i. 153). Fortunately we have in Bishop Caldwell a proof that comparative grammar does not preclude good manners. Mr. Beames was evidently in entire ignorance of the facts which render the origin of the Anglo-Indian word so curiously ambiguous; but we shall not call him the \"wise-acre grammarian.\" Vara\u1e47\u1e0da, with the meaning in question, does not, it may be observed, belong to the older Sanskrit, but is only found in comparatively modern works.*\n Littr\u00e9 also gives as follows (1874): \"ETYM. Verandah, mot rapport\u00e9 de l'Inde par les Anglais, est la simple d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence, dans les langues modernes de l'Inde, du Sansc. veranda, colonnade, de var, couvrir.\"\n That the word as used in England and in France was brought by the English from India need not be doubted. But either in the same sense, or in one closely analogous, it appears to have existed, quite independently, in Portuguese and Spanish; and the manner in which it occurs without explanation in the very earliest narrative of the adventure of the Portuguese in India, as quoted below, seems almost to preclude the possibility of their having learned it in that country for the first time; whilst its occurrence in P. de Alcala can leave no doubt on the subject.

B.\n Interpreting these Arabic words, with the assistance of Prof. Robertson Smith, we find that ta\u0302rbu\u00e7 is, according to Dozy (Suppt.

It is apparently from the Skt. vadana, \". . . the act of speaking . . . the mouth, face, countenance . . . the front, point,\" &c. In Javanese wadana (or wadono, in Jav. pronunciation) is \"the face, front, van; a chief of high rank: a Javanese title\" (Crawfurd, s.v.). The Javanese title is, we imagine, now only traditional; the Ceylonese one has followed the usual downward track of high titles; we can hardly doubt the common Sanskrit origin of both (see Athenaeum, April 1, 1882, p. 413, and May 13, ibid. p. 602).

In Ceylon a Buddhist temple. Skt. vih\u0101r\u0101, a Buddhist convent, originally the hall where the monks met, and thence extended to the buildings generally of such an institution, and to the shrine which was attached to them, much as minster has come from monasterium. Though there are now no Buddhist vih\u0101ras in India Proper, the former wide diffusion of such establishments has left its trace in the names of many noted places: e.g. Bih\u0101r, and the great province which takes its name; Kuch Beh\u0101r; the Vih\u0101r water - works at Bombay; and most probably the City of Bokh\u0101r\u0101 itself. [Numerous ruins of such buildings have been unearthed in N. India, as, for instance, that at Sarn\u0101th near Benares, of which an account is given by Gen. Cunningham (Arch. Rep. i. 121).

Ar. -- H. waz\u012br, 'a minister,' and usually the principal minister, under a (Mahommedan) prince.
