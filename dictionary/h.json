{"hackery": "s. In the Bengal Presidency this word is now applied only to the common native bullockcart used in the slow draught of goods and materials. But formerly in Bengal, as still in Western India and Ceylon, the word was applied to lighter carriages (drawn by bullocks) for personal transport. In Broughton's Letters from a Mahratta Camp (p. 156; [ed. 1892, p. 117]) the word is used for what in Upper India is commonly called an ekka (q.v.), or light native pony-carriage; but this is an exceptional application. Though the word is used by Englishmen almost universally in India, it is unknown to natives, or if known is regarded as an English term; and its origin is exceedingly obscure. The word seems to have originated on the west side of India, where we find it in our earliest quotations. It is probably one of those numerous words which were long in use, and undergoing corruption by illiterate soldiers and sailors, before they appeared in any kind of literature. Wilson suggests a probable Portuguese origin, e.g. from acarretar, 'to convey in a cart.' It is possible that the mere Portuguese article and noun 'a carreta' might have produced the Anglo-Indian hackery. Thus in Correa, under 1513, we have a description of the Surat hackeries; \"and the carriages (as carretas) in which he and the Portuguese travelled, were elaborately wrought, and furnished with silk hangings, covering them from the sun; and these carriages (as carretas) run so smoothly (the country consisting of level plains) that the people travelling in them sleep as tranquilly as on the ground\" (ii. 369).\n But it is almost certain that the origin of the word is the H. chhakra, 'a two-wheeled cart'; and it may be noted that in old Singhalese chakka, 'a cart-wheel,' takes the forms haka and saka (see Kuhn, On Oldest Aryan Elements of Singhalese, translated by D. Ferguson in Indian Ant. xii. 64). [But this can have no connection with chhakra, which represents Skt. \u015baka\u1e6da, 'a waggon.']\n 1673. -- \"The Coach wherein I was breaking, we were forced to mount the Indian Hackery, a Two-wheeled Chariot, drawn by swift little Oxen.\" -- Fryer, 83.

The word is literally 'single' or 'alone' (A. a\u1e25ad, 'one'). It is easy to see why this name was applied to them; they offered their services singly, they did not attach themselves to any chief, thus forming a class apart from the t\u0101b\u012bn\u0101n; but as they were horsemen, they stood equally apart from the specialised services included under the remaining head of A\u1e25sh\u0101m.\" (J.

Prof. Robertson Smith writes: \"There is current confusion about the word \u1e25\u0101jj. It is originally the participle of \u1e25ajj, 'he went on the \u1e25ajj.' But in modern use \u1e25\u0101jij is used as part., and \u1e25\u0101jj is the title given to one who has made the pilgrimage. When this is prefixed to a name, the double j cannot be pronounced without inserting a short vowel and the a is shortened; thus you say 'el-Hajje\u0306 Soleim\u0101n,' or the like.

The large shad which of late has been commonly sold by London fishmongers in the beginning of summer, is very near the hilsa, but not so rich. The hilsa is a sea-fish, ascending the river to spawn, and is taken as high as Delhi on the Jumna, as high as Mandalay on the Irawadi (Day). It is also taken in the Guzerat rivers, though not in the short and shallow streams of the Concan, nor in the Deccan rivers, from which it seems to be excluded by the rocky obstructions.

We do not know how far back the use of the modern name is to be found. [The references in early Hindu literature are collected by Atkinson (Hima layan Gazetteer, ii. 273 seqq.).] We do not find it in Baber, who gives Siw\u0101lak as the Indian name of the mountains (see SIWALIK).

This is disguised in Gladwin's version by a wrong reading into Kerdehmaleh (ed. 1800, ii. 367).* This form (Himmaleh) is used by Major Rennell, but hardly as if it was yet a familiar term. In Elphinstone's Letters Him\u0101leh or some other spelling of that form is always used (see below).

This is the Pers. adjective form from Hind, 'India,' and illustration of its use for a native of India will be found under HINDOO. By Europeans it is most commonly used for those dialects of Hindustani speech which are less modified by P. vocables than the usual Hindustani, and which are spoken by the rural population of the N.W. Provinces and its outskirts. The earliest literary work in Hindi is the great poem of Chand Bardai (c. 1200), which records the deeds of Prithir\u0101ja, the last Hindu sovereign of Delhi. [On this literature see Dr. G. A. Grierson, The Modern Vernacular Literature ofHindust\u0101n, in J.A.S.B.

Arbuthnot's ed. of Munro's Minutes, i. 133.)\n Hem\u0101chal and Hemak\u016bt also occur in the \u0100\u012bn (see Gladwin, ii. 342, 343; [ed. Jarrett, iii. 30, 31]). Kar\u0101chal is the name used by Ibn Batuta in the 14th century, and by Al-Bir\u016bni 300 years earlier. 17th century writers often call the Him\u0101laya the \"Mountains of Nuggur-Cote\" (q.v.). [Mr. Tawney writes: \"We have in \u1e5aig Veda (x. 121) ime himavanto parvat\u0101\u1e25, 'these snowy mountains,' spoken of as abiding by the might of Praj\u0101pati.

Hind\u016b- K\u016bsh; a term applied by our geographers to the whole of the Alpine range which separates the basins of the Kabul River and the Helmand from that of the Oxus. It is, as Rennell points out, properly that part of the range immediately north of Kabul, the Caucasus of the historians of Alexander, who crossed and recrossed it somewhere not far from the longitude of that city. The real origin of the name is not known; [the most plausible explanation is perhaps that it is a corruption of Indicus Caucasus]. It is, as far as we know, first used in literature by Ibn Batuta, and the explanation of the name which he gives, however doubtful, is still popular. The name has been by some later writers modified into Hindu Koh (mountain), but this is factitious, and throws no light on the origin of the name.\n c. 1334. -- \"Another motive for our stoppage was the fear of snow; for there is midway on the road a mountain called Hind\u016bK\u016bsh, i.e. 'the Hindu-Killer,' because so many of the slaves, male and female, brought from India, die in the passage of this mountain, owing to the severe cold and quantity of snow.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 84.\n 1504. -- \"The country of Ka\u0302bul is very strong, and of difficult access. . . .

A repulsively smelling gum-resin which forms a favourite Hindu condiment, and is used also by Europeans in Western and Southern India as an ingredient in certain cakes eaten with curry. (See POPPER-CAKE). This product affords a curious example of the uncertainty which sometimes besets the origin of drugs which are the objects even of a large traffic. Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger, whilst describing Falconer's Narthex Asafoetida (Ferula Narthex, Boiss.) and Scorodosma foetidum, Bunge; (F. asafoetida, Boiss.) two umbelliferous plants, both cited as the source of this drug, say that neither has been proved to furnish the asafoetida of commerce. Yet the plant producing it has been described and drawn by Kaempfer, who saw the gum-resin collected in the Persian Province of L\u0101rist\u0101n (near the eastern shore of the P. Gulf); and in recent years (1857) Surgeon-Major Bellew has described the collection of the drug near Kandahar. Asafoetida has been identified with the SI/LFION or laserpitium of the ancients. The substance is probably yielded not only by the species mentioned above, but by other allied plants, e.g. Ferula Jaeschki ana, Vatke, of Kashm\u012br and Turkistan.

Mem. ii. 101, 2nd ed.]\n", "hobson-jobson": "s. A native festal excitement; a tam\u0101sha (see TUMASHA); but especially the Moharram ceremonies. This phrase may be taken as a typical one of the most highly assimilated class of Anglo-Indian argot, and we have ventured to borrow from it a concise alternative title for this Glossary. It is peculiar to the British soldier and his surroundings, with whom it probably originated, and with whom it is by no means obsolete, as we once supposed. My friend Major John Trotter tells me that he has repeatedly heard it used by British soldiers in the Punjab; and has heard it also from a regimental Moonshee. It is in fact an Anglo-Saxon version of the wailings of the Mahommedans as they beat their breasts in the procession of the Moharram -- \"Y\u0101 Hasan! Y\u0101 Hosain!' It is to be remembered that these observances are in India by no means confined to Sh\u012b'as. Except at Lucknow and Mursh\u012bd\u0101b\u0101d, the great majority of Mahommedans in that country are professed Sunnis. Yet here is a statement of the facts from an unexceptionable authority:\n \"The commonalty of the Mussalmans, and especially the women, have more regard for the memory of Hasan and Husein, than for that of Muhammad and his khalifs. The heresy of making Ta'ziyas (see TAZEEA) on the anniversary of the two latter im\u00e1ms, is most common throughout India: so much so that opposition to it is ascribed by the ignorant to blasphemy. This example is followed by many of the Hindus, especially the Mahrattas. The Muharram is celebrated throughout the Dekhan and Malwa, with greater enthusiasm than in other parts of India. Grand preparations are made in every town on the occasion, as if for a festival of rejoicing, rather than of observing the rites of mourning, as they ought. The observance of this custom has so strong a hold on the mind of the commonalty of the Mussulmans that they believe Muhammadanism to depend merely on keeping the memory of the im\u00e1ms in the above manner.\" -- M\u012br Shah\u0101mat 'Ali, in J.R. As. Soc. xiii. 369.\n We find no literary quotation to exemplify the phrase as it stands. [But see those from the Orient.

The Chinese word is hang, meaning 'a row or rank'; a house of business; at Canton a warehouse, a factory, and particularly applied to the establishments of the European nations (\"Foreign Hongs\"), and to those of the so-called \"HongMerchants.\" These were a body of merchants who had the monopoly of trade with foreigners, in return for which privilege they became security for the good behaviour of the foreigners, and for their payment of dues. The guild of these merchants was called 'The Hong.' The monopoly seems to have been first established about 1720 30, and it was terminated under the Treaty of Nanking, in 1842. The Hong merchants are of course not mentioned in Lockyer (1711), nor by A. Hamilton (in China previous to and after 1700, pubd. 1727). The latter uses the word, however, and the rudiments of the institution may be traced not only in this narrative, but in that of Ibn Batuta.\n c. 1346. -- \"When a Musulman trader arrives in a Chinese city, he is allowed to choose whether he will take up his quarters with one of the merchants of his own faith settled in the country, or will go to an inn.

The true *NA/OURA must have been Cannanore, or Pudopatana, a little south of the last. [The Madras Gloss. explains *NA/OURA as the country of the Nairs.] The long defence of Honore by Captain Torriano, of the Bombay Artillery, against the forces of Tippoo, in 1783-1784, is one of the most noble records of the Indian army.

Going back further some twelve or fifteen years it was not very uncommon to see the use of the hooka kept up by old Indians after their return to Europe; one such at least, in the recollection of the elder of the present writers in his childhood, being a lady who continued its use in Scotland for several years. When the second of the present writers landed first at Madras, in 1860, there were perhaps half-adozen Europeans at the Presidency who still used the hooka; there is not one now (c. 1878). A few gentlemen at Hyderabad are said still to keep it up.

It is used as a generic name for a number of tribes occupying some of the wildest parts of Afghanistan, chiefly N.W. and S W. of Kabul. These tribes are in no respect Afghan, but are in fact most or all of them Mongol in features, and some of them also in language. The term at one time appears to have been used more generally for a variety of the wilder clans in the higher hill countries of Afghanistan and the Oxus basin, much as in Scotland of a century and a half ago they spoke of \"the clans.\" It appears to be merely from the Pers. haz\u0101r, 1000. The regiments, so to speak, of the Mongol hosts of Chinghiz and his immediate successors were called haz\u0101ras, and if we accept the belief that the Haz\u0101ras of Afghanistan were predatory bands of those hosts who settled in that region (in favour of which there is a good deal to be said), this name is intelligible. If so, its application to the non-Mongol people of Wakh\u0101n, &c., must have been a later transfer. [See the discussion by Bellew, who points out that \"amongst themselves this people never use the term Haz\u0101rah as their national appellation, and yet they have no name for their people as a nation. They are only known amongst themselves by the names of their principal tribes and the clans subordinate to them respectively.\" (Races ofAfghanistan, 114.)]\n c. 1480. -- \"The Haz\u0101ra, Takdari, and all the other tribes having seen this, quietly submitted to his authority.\" -- Tarkh\u00e1nN\u00e1ma, in Elliot, i. 303.

But is not the word Haz\u00e1ras here, 'the clans,' used elliptically for the highland districts occupied by them?\n [c. 1590. -- \"The Haz\u00e1rahs are the descendants of the Chaghatai army, sent by Manku \u1e32\u00e1\u00e1n to the assistance of Hul\u00e1ku Kh\u00e1n. . . .

The name of this region apparently has nothing to do with Haz\u0101ras in the tribal sense, but is probably a survival of the ancient name of a territory in this quarter, called in Sanskrit Abhis\u0101ra, and figuring in Ptolemy, Arrian and Curtius as the kingdom of King Abisar\u0113s.
