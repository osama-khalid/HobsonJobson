{"lac": "s. Hind. l\u0101kh, from Skt. l\u0101ksh\u0101, for r\u0101ksh\u0101. The resinous incrustation produced on certain trees (of which the dh\u0101k (see DHAWK) is one, but chiefly Peepul, and khossum [kusum, kusumb], i.e. Schleichera bijuga, trijuga) by the puncture of the Lac insect (Coccus Lacca, L.). See Roxburgh, in Vol. III. As. Res., 384 seqq; [and a full list of the trees on which the insect feeds, in Watt, Econ. Dict. ii. 410 seq.]. The incrustation contains 60 to 70 per cent. of resinous lac, and 10 per cent. of dark red colouring matter from which is manufactured lac-dye. The material in its original crude form is called stick-lac; when boiled in water it loses its red colour, and is then termed seed-lac; the melted clarified substance, after the extraction of the dye, is turned out in thin irregular laminae called shelllac.  This is used to make sealing-wax, in the fabrication of varnishes, and very largely as a stiffening for men's hats.\n Though l\u0101k bears the same sense in Persian, and lak or luk are used in modern Arabic for sealing-wax, it would appear from Dozy (Glos., pp. 295-6, and Oosterlingen, 57), that identical or approximate forms are used in various Arabic-speaking regions for a variety of substances giving a red dye, including the coccus ilicis or Kermes. Still, we have seen no evidence that in India the word was applied otherwise than to the lac of our heading. (Garcia says that the Arabs called it loc-summutri, 'lac of Sumatra'; probably because the Pegu lac was brought to the ports of Sumatra, and purchased there.) And this the term in the Periplus seems unquestionably to indicate; whilst it is probable that the passage quoted from Aelian is a much misconceived account of the product. It is not nearly so absurd as De Monfart's account below. The English word lake for a certain red colour is from this. So also are lacquer and lackered ware, because lac is used in some of the varnishes with which such ware is prepared.\n c. A.D. 80-90. -- These articles are imported (to the ports of Barbaric\u0113, on the W. of the Red Sea) from the interior parts of Ariak\u0113:-\n \"*SI/DHROS *)INDIKO\\S KAI\\ STO/MWMA (Indian iron and steel) * * * * * *AA/KKOS XRWMA/TINOS (Lac-dye).\" Periplus, \u0015 6.\n c. 250. -- \"There are produced in India animals of the size of a beetle, of a red colour, and if you saw them for the first time you would compare them to cinnabar. They have very long legs, and are soft to the touch; they are produced on the trees that bear electrum, and they feed on the fruit of these. The Indians catch them and crush them, and with these dye their red cloaks, and the tunics under these, and everything else that they wish to turn to this colour, and to dye. And this kind of clothing is carried also to the King of Persia.\" -- Aelian, de Nat. Animal. iv. 46.\n c. 1343. -- The notice of lacca in Pegolotti is in parts very difficult to translate, and we do not feel absolutely certain that it refers to the Indian product, though we believe it to be so. Thus, after explaining that there are two classes of lacca, the matura and acerba, or ripe and unripe, he goes on: \"It is produced attached to stalks, i.e. to the branches of shrubs, but it ought to be clear from stalks, and earthy dust, and sand, and from costiere (?). The stalks are the twigs of the wood on which it is produced, the costiere or figs, as the Catalans call them, are composed of the dust of the thing, which when it is fresh heaps together and hardens like pitch; only that pitch is black, and those costiere or figs are red and of the colour of unripe lacca. And more of these costiere is found in the unripe than the ripe lacca,\" and so on. -- Della Decima, iii. 365.\n 1510. -- \"There also grows a very large quantity of lacca (or lacra) for making red colour, and the tree of this is formed like our trees which produce walnuts.\"- Varthema, 238.\n 1516. -- \"Here (in Pegu) they load much fine laquar, which grows in the country.\"- Barbosa, Lisbon Acad., 366.\n 1519. -- \"And because he had it much in charge to get all the lac (alacre) that he could, the governor knowing through information of the merchants that much came to the Coast of Choromandel by the ships of Pegu and Martaban that frequented that coast. . . .\" -- Correa, ii. 567.\n 1563. -- \"Now it is time to speak of the lacre, of which so much is consumed in this country in closing letters, and for other seals, in the place of wax.\" -- Garcia, f. 112v.\n 1582. -- \"Laker is a kinde of gum that procedeth of the ant.\" -- Casta\u00f1eda, tr. by N.L., f. 33.\n c. 1590. -- (Recipe for Lac varnish). \"Lac is used for chighs (see CHICK, a).

Lak\u015badv\u012bpa, '100,000 Islands'; a name however which would apply much better to the Maldives, for the former are not really very numerous. There is not, we suspect, any ancient or certain native source for the name as specifically applied to the northern group of islands. Barbosa, the oldest authority we know as mentioning the group (1516), calls them Malandiva, and the Maldives Palandiva. Several of the individual islands are mentioned in the Tuhfat-al-Maj\u0101hid\u012bn (E.T. by Rowlandson, pp. 150-52), the group itself being called \"the islands of Malabar.\"\n", "lack": "s. One hundred thousand, and especially in the Anglo-Indian colloquial 100,000 Rupees, in the days of better exchange the equivalent of \u00a310,000. Hind. l\u0101kh, lak, &c., from Skt. laksha, used (see below) in the same sense, but which appears to have originally meant \"a mark.\" It is necessary to explain that the term does not occur in the earlier Skt. works. Thus in the Talavak\u0101raBr\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101, a complete series of the higher numerical terms is given. After \u015bata (10), sahasra (1000), comes ayuta (10,000), prayuta (now a million), niyuta (now also a million), arbuda (100 millions), nyarbuda (not now used), nikhar\u1e47a (do.), and padma (now 10,000 millions). Laksha is therefore a modern substitute for prayuta, and the series has been expanded. This was probably done by the I\u1e45dian astronomers between the 5th and 10th centuries A.D.\n The word has been adopted in the Malay and Javanese, and other languages of the Archipelago. But it is remarkable that in all of this class of languages which have adopted the word it is used in the sense of 10,000 instead of 100,000 with the sole exception of the Lampungs of Sumatra, who use it correctly. (Crawfurd). (See CRORE.)\n We should observe that though a lack, used absolutely for a sum of money, in modern times always implies rupees, this has not always been the case. Thus in the time of Akbar and his immediate successors the revenue was settled and reckoned in laks of dams (q.v.). Thus:\n c. 1594. -- \"In the 40th year of his majesty's reign (Akbar's), his dominions consisted of 105 Sircars, subdivided into 2737 Kusbahs (see CUSBAH), the revenue of which he settled for ten years, at the annual rent of 3 Arribs, 62 Crore, 97 Lacks, 55,246 Dams. . . .\" -- Ayeen, ed. Gladwin, ii. 1; [ed. Jarrett, ii. 115].\n At Ormuz again we find another lack in vogue, of which the unit was apparently the d\u012bn\u0101r, not the old gold coin, but a degenerate d\u012bn\u0101r of small value. Thus:\n 1554. -- \"(Money of Ormuz). -- A leque is equivalent to 50 pardaos of \u00e7adis, which is called 'bad money,' (and this leque is not a coin but a number by which they reckon at Ormuz): and each of these pardaos is equal to 2 azares, and each azar to 10 \u00e7adis, each \u00e7adi to 100 dinars, and after this fashion they calculate in the books of the Custom-house. . . .\" -- Nunez, Lyvro dos Pesos, &c., in Subsidios, 25.\n Here the azar is the Persian haz\u0101r or 1000 (d\u012bn\u0101rs); the \u00e7adi Pers. sad or 100 (d\u012bn\u0101rs); the leque or lak, 100,000 (d\u012bn\u0101rs); and the tom\u0101n (see TOMAUN), which does not appear here, is 10,000 (d\u012bn\u0101rs).\n c. 1300. -- \"They went to the K\u0101fir's tent, killed him, and came back into the town, whence they carried off money belonging to the Sultan amounting to 12 laks. The lak is a sum of 100,000 (silver) d\u012bn\u0101rs, equivalent to 10,000 Indian gold d\u012bn\u0101rs.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 106.\n c. 1340. -- \"The Sultan distributes daily two l\u0101ks in alms, never less; a sum of which the equivalent in money of Egypt and Syria would be 160,000 pieces of silver.\"- Shih\u0101budd\u012bn Dimishki, in Notes and Exts., xiii. 192.\n In these examples from Pinto the word is used apart from money, in the Malay form, but not in the Malay sense of 10,000:\n c. 1540. -- \"The old man desiring to satisfie Antonio de Faria's demand, Sir, said he . . . the chronicles of those times affirm, how in only four yeares and an half sixteen Lacazaas (lacas\u00e1) of men were slain, every Lacazaa containing an hundred thousand.\"- Pinto (orig. cap. xlv.) in Cogan, p. 53.\n c. 1546. -- \". . . he ruined in 4 months space all the enemies countries, with such a destruction of people as, if credit may be given to our histories . . . there died fifty Laquesaas of persons.\" -- Ibid. p. 224.\n 1615. -- \"And the whole present was worth ten of their Leakes, as they call them; a Leake being 10,000 pounds sterling; the whole 100,000 pounds sterling.\" -- Coryat's Letters from India (Crudities, iii. f. 25v).\n 1616. -- \"He received twenty lecks of roupies towards his charge (two hundred thousand pounds sterling).\" -- Sir T.

A name applied by the Portuguese to the civilised people who occupied the inland frontier of Burma and Siam, between those countries on the one hand and China and Tongking on the other; a people called by the Burmese Shans, a name which we have in recent years adopted. They are of the same race of Thai to which the Siamese belong, and which extends with singular identity of manners and language, though broken into many separate communities, from Assam to the Malay Peninsula. The name has since been frequently used as a singular, and applied as a territorial name to the region occupied by this people immediately to the North of Siam. There have been a great number of separate principalities in this region, of which now one and now another predominated and conquered its neighbours. Before the rise of Siam the most important was that of which Sakotai was the capital, afterwards represented by Xieng-mai, the Zimm\u00e9 of the Burmese and the Jangomay of some old English documents. In later times the chief States were Muang Luang Praban (see LAN JOHN) and Vien-shan, both upon the Mekong. It would appear from Lieut.

A kind of drink -- apparently a sort of punch -- which was popular in the Company's old factories. We know the word only on the authority of Pietro della Valle; but he is the most accurate of travellers. We are in the dark as to the origin of the name. On the one hand its form suggests an eponymus among the old servants of the Company, such as Robert Larkin, whom we find to have been engaged for the service in 1610, and to have died chief of the Factory of Patani, on the E. coast of the Malay Peninsula, in 1616. But again we find in a Vocabulary of \"Certaine Wordes of the Naturall Language of Iaua,\" in Drake's Voyage (Hak. iv. 246): \"Larnike==Drinke.\" Of this word we can trace nothing nearer than (Javan.) larih, 'to pledge, or invite to drink at an entertainment,' and (Malay) larih-larahan, 'mutual pledging to drink.' It will be observed that della Valle assigns the drink especially to Java.\n 1623. -- \"Meanwhile the year 1622 was drawing near its close, and its last days were often celebrated of an evening in the House of the English, with good fellowship. And on one of these occasions I learned from them how to make a beverage called Larkin, which they told me was in great vogue in Java, and in all those other islands of the Far East. This said beverage seemed to me in truth an admirable thing, -- not for use at every meal (it is too strong for that), -- but as a tonic in case of debility, and to make tasty possets, much better than those we make with Muscatel wines or Cretan malmseys. So I asked for the recipe; and am taking it to Italy with me. . . . It seemed odd to me that those hot southern regions, as well as in the environs of Hormuz here, where also the heat is great, they should use both spice in their food and spirits in their drink, as well as sundry other hot beverages like this larkin.\" -- P. della Valle, ii. 475.\n", "larry-bunder": "n.p. The name of an old seaport in the Delta of the Indus, which succeeded Daibul (see DIUL-SIND) as the chief haven of Sind. We are doubtful of the proper orthography. It was in later Mahommedan times called L\u0101hor\u012b - bandar, probably from presumed connection with Lahore as the port of the Punjab (Elliot, i. 378). At first sight M'Murdo's suggestion that the original name may have been L\u0101r\u012b-bandar, from L\u0101r, the local name of the southern part of Sind, seems probable. M'Murdo, indeed, writing about 1820, says that the name L\u0101r\u012b-Bandar was not at all familiar to natives; but if accustomed to the form L\u0101hor\u012b-bandar they might not recognize it in the other.

The word is originally from Pers. lashkar, 'an army,' 'a camp.' This is usually derived from Ar. al'askar, but it would rather seem that Ar. 'askar, 'an army' is taken from this Pers. word: whence lashkar\u012b, 'one belonging to an army, a soldier.' The word lasc\u00e1r or l\u00e1sc\u00e1r (both these pronunciations are in vogue) appears to have been corrupted, through the Portuguese use of lashkar\u012b in the forms lasquarin, lascari, &c., either by the Portuguese themselves, or by the Dutch and English who took up the word from them, and from these lask\u0101r has passed back again into native use in this corrupt shape. The early Portuguese writers have the forms we have just named in the sense of 'soldier'; but lascar is never so used now. It is in general the equivalent of khal\u0101s\u012b, in the various senses of that word (see CLASSY), viz. (1) an inferior class of artilleryman ('gun-lascar'); (2) a tent-pitcher, doing other work which the class are accustomed to do; (3) a sailor. The last is the most common Anglo-Indian use, and has passed into the English language. The use of lascar in the modern sense by Pyrard de Laval shows that this use was already general on the west coast at the beginning of the 17th century, [also see quotation from Pringle below]; whilst the curious distinction which Pyrard makes between Lascar and Lascari; and Dr. Fryer makes between Luscar and Lascar (accenting probably L\u00fascar and Lasc\u00e1r) shows that lashkar\u012b for a soldier was still in use. In Ceylon the use of the word lascareen for a local or civil soldier long survived; perhaps is not yet extinct.

A term, first used by Dr. Francis Buchanan, to indicate a reddish brick-like argillaceous formation much impregnated with iron peroxide, and hardening on exposure to the atmosphere, which is found in places all over South India from one coast to the other, and the origin of which geologists find very obscure. It is found in two distinct types: viz. (1) High-level Laterite, capping especially the trap-rocks of the Deccan, with a bed from 30 or 40 to 200 feet in thickness, which perhaps at one time extended over the greater part of Peninsular India. This is found as far north as the Rajmahal and Monghyr hills. (2). Low-level Laterite, forming comparatively thin and sloping beds on the plains of the coast. The origin of both is regarded as being, in the most probable view, modified volcanic matter; the low-level laterite having undergone a further rearrangement and deposition; but the matter is too complex for brief statement (see Newbold, in J.R.A.S., vol. viii.; and the Manual of the Geol. of India, pp. xlv. seqq., 348 seqq.). Mr. King and others have found flint weapons in the lowlevel formation. Laterite is the usual material for road-metal in S. India, as kunkur (q.v.) is in the north. In Ceylon it is called cabook (q.v.).\n 1800. -- \"It is diffused in immense masses, without any appearance of stratification, and is placed over the granite that forms the basis of Malayala. . . .

This was the official designation of a Mahommedan officer learned in the (Mahommedan) law, who was for many years of our Indian administration an essential functionary of the judges' Courts in the districts, as well as of the Sudder or Courts of Review at the Presidency.\n It is to be remembered that the law administered in Courts under the Company's government, from the assumption of the Dewanny of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, was the Mahommedan law; at first by the hands of native Cazees and Mufties, with some superintendence from the higher European servants of the Company; a superintendence which, while undergoing sundry vicissitudes of system during the next 30 years, developed gradually into a European judiciary, which again was set on an extended and quasi-permanent footing by Lord Cornwallis's Government, in Regulation IX. of 1793 (see ADAWLUT). The Mahommedan law continued, however, to be the professed basis of criminal jurisprudence, though modified more and more, as years went on, by new Regulations, and by the recorded constructions and circular orders of the superior Courts, until the accomplishment of the great changes which followed the Mutiny, and the assumption of the direct government of India by the Crown (1858). The landmarks of change were (a) the enactment of the Penal Code (Act XLV. of 1860), and (b) that of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Act. XXV. of 1861), followed by (c) the establishment of the High Court (July 1, 1862), in which became merged both the Supreme Court with its peculiar jurisdiction, and the (quondam-Company's) Sudder Courts of Review and Appeal, civil and criminal (Dewanny Adawlvt, and Nizamat Adawlut).\n The authoritative exposition of the Mahommedan Law, in aid and guidance of the English judges, was the function of the Mahommedan Lawofficer. He sat with the judge on the bench at Sessions, i.e. in the hearing of criminal cases committed by the magistrate for trial; and at the end of the trial he gave in his written record of the proceedings with his Futwa (q.v.) (see Regn. IX. 1793, sect. 47), which was his judgment as to the guilt of the accused, as to the definition of the crime, and as to its appropriate punishment according to Mahommedan Law. The judge was bound attentively to consider the futwa, and if it seemed to him to be consonant with natural justice, and also in conformity with the Mahommedan Law, he passed sentence (save in certain excepted cases) in its terms, and issued his warrant to the magistrate for execution of the sentence, unless it were one of death, in which case the proceedings had to be referred to the Sudder Nizamut for confirmation. In cases also where there was disagreement between the civilian judge and the Law-officer, either as to finding or sentence, the matter was referred to the Sudder Court for ultimate decision.\n In 1832, certain modifications were introduced by law (Regn. VI. of that year), which declared that the futwa might be dispensed with either by referring the case for report to a punchayet (q.v.), which sat apart from the Court; or by constituting assessors in the trial (generally three in number). The frequent adoption of the latter alternative rendered the appearance of the Law-officer and his futwa much less universal as time went on. The post of Law-officer was indeed not actually abolished till 1864. But it would appear from enquiry that I have made, among friends of old standing in the Civil Service, that for some years before the issue of the Penal Code and the other reforms already mentioned, the Moolvee (maulav\u012b) or Mahommedan Law-officer had, in some at least of the Bengal districts, practically ceased to sit with the judge, even in cases where no assessors were summoned.* I cannot trace any legislative authority for this, nor any Circular of the Sudder Nizamut; and it is not easy, at this time of day, to obtain much personal testimony. But Sir George Yule (who was Judge of Rungpore and Bogra about 1855-56) writes thus:\n \"The Moulvee-ship . . . must have been abolished before I became a judge (I think), which was 2 or 3 years before the Mutiny; for I have no recollection of ever sitting with a Moulvee, and I had a great number of heavy criminal cases to try in Rungpore and Bogra. Assessors were substituted for the Moulvee in some cases, but I have no recollection of employing these either.\"\n Mr. Seton-Karr, again, who was Civil and Sessions Judge of Jessore (1857-1860), writes:\n \"I am quite certain of my own practice . . . and I made deliberate choice of native assessors, whenever the law required me to have such functionaries. I determined never to sit with a Maulavi, as, even before the Penal Code was passed, and came into operation, I wished to get rid of futwas and differences of opinion.\"\n The office of Law-officer was formally abolished by Act XI. of 1864.\n In respect of civil litigation, it had been especially laid down (Regn. of April 11, 1780, quoted below) that in suits regarding successions, inheritance, marriage, caste, and all religious usages Reg. I. of 1810 had empowered the Executive Government, by an official communication from its Secretary in the Judicial Department, to dispense with the attendance and futwa of the Law officers of the courts of circuit, when it seemed advisable. But in such case the judge of the court passed no sentence, but referred the proceedings with an opinion to the Nizamut Adawlut.\n and institutions, the Mahommedan laws with respect to Mahommedans, and the Hind\u016b laws with respect to Hind\u016bs, were to be considered as the general rules by which the judges were to form their decisions. In the respective cases, it was laid down, the Mahommedan and Hind\u016b law-officers of the court were to attend and expound the law.\n In this note I have dealt only with the Mahommedan law - officer, whose presence and co-operation was so long (it has been seen) essential in a criminal trial. In civil cases he did not sit with the judge (at least in memory of man now living), but the judge could and did, in case of need, refer to him on any point of Mahommedan Law. The Hind\u016b law-officer (Pundit) is found in the legislation of 1793, and is distinctly traceable in the Regulations down at least to 1821. In fact he is named in the Act XI. of 1864 (see quotation under CAZEE) abolishing Law-officers. But in many of the districts it would seem that he had very long before 1860 practically ceased to exist, under what circumstances exactly I have failed to discover. He had nothing to do with criminal justice, and the occasions for reference to him were presumably not frequent enough to justify his maintenance in every district. A Pundit continued to be attached to the Sudder Dewanny, and to him questions were referred by the District Courts when requisite. Neither Pundit nor Moolvee is attached to the High Court, but native judges sit on its Bench. It need only be added that under Regulation III. of 1821, a magistrate was authorized to refer for trial to the Law-officer of his district a variety of complaints and charges of a trivial character. The designation of the Lawofficer was Maulavi. (See ADAWLUT, CAZEE, FUTWA, MOOLVEE, MUFTY.)\n 1780. -- \"That in all suits regarding inheritance, marriage, and caste, and other religious usages or institutions, the laws of the Koran with respect to Mahommedans, and those of the Shaster with respect to Gentoos, shall be invariably adhered to.

Thus in the 8th century, data quoted by M. Vivien de St. Martin, from P\u00e8re Gaubil, show that the l\u012b was little more than \u2155 of an English mile.

We insert this in order to remark that there has been a great deal of controversy among Indian sportsmen, and also among naturalists, as to whether there are or are not two species of this Cat, distinguished by those who maintain the affirmative, as panther (F. pardus) and leopard (Felis leopardus), the latter being the smaller, though by some these names are reversed. Even those who support this distinction of species appear to admit that the markings, habits, and general appearance (except size) of the two animals are almost identical. Jerdon describes the two varieties, but (with Blyth) classes both as one species (Felis pardus). [Mr. Blanford takes the same view: \"I cannot help suspecting that the difference is very often due to age. . . . I have for years endeavoured to distinguish the two forms, but without success.\" (Mammalia of India, 68 seq.)]\n", "lewchew": "&c., n.p. The name of a group of islands to the south of Japan, a name much more familiar than in later years during the 16th century, when their people habitually navigated the China seas, and visited the ports of the Archipelago.

[Mr. Chamberlain writes the name Luchu, and says that it is pronounced D\u016bch\u016b by the natives and Ry\u016bky\u016b by the Japanese (Things Japanese, 3rd ed. p. 267). Mr. Pringle traces the name in the \"Gold flowered loes\" which appear in a Madras list of 1684, and which he supposes to be \"a name invented for the occasion to describe some silk stuff brought from the Liu Kiu islands.\" (Diary Ft.

This is the name which the older writers, especially Portuguese, give to the Chinese port which we now call Ning-Po. It is a form of corruption which appears in other cases of names used by the Portuguese, or of those who learned from them. Thus Nanking is similarly called Lanchin in the publications of the same age, and Yunnan appears in Mendoza as Olam.\n 1540. -- \"Sailing in this manner we arrived six dayes after at the Ports of Liampoo, which are two Islands one just against another, distant three Leagues from the place, where at that time the Portugals used their commerce; There they had built above a thousand houses, that were governed by Sheriffs, Auditors, Consuls, Judges, and 6 or 7 other kinde of Officers [com governan\u00e7a de Vereadores, & Ouvidor, & Alcaides, & outras seis ou sete Varas de Justi\u00e7a & Officiaes de Republica], where the Notaries underneath the publique Acts which they made, wrote thus, I, such a one, publique Notarie of this Town of Liampoo for the King our Soveraign Lord.

And the expression is remarkable as preserving a very old tradition of Eastern navigation; the oldest document regarding Arab trade to China (the Relation, tr. by Reinaud) says that the ships after crossing the Sea of Sanji 'pass the Gates of China. These Gates are in fact mountains washed by the sea; between these mountains is an opening, through which the ships pass' (p. 19). This phrase was perhaps a translation of a term used by the Chinese themselves -- see under BOCCA TIGRIS.\n 1553. -- \"The eighth (division of the coasts of the Indies) terminates in a notable cape, the most easterly point of the whole continent so far as we know at present, and which stands about midway in the whole coast of that great country China.

We borrow from Mr. Giles \"An arbitrary tax, originally of one cash per tael on all kinds of produce, imposed with a view of making up the deficiency in the land-tax of China caused by the T'aiping and Nienfei troubles. It was to be set aside for military purposes only -- hence its common name of 'war tax'. . . The Chefoo Agreement makes the area of the Foreign concessions at the various Treaty Ports exempt from the tax of Lekin\" (Gloss. of Reference, s.v.). The same authority explains the term as \"li (le, i.e. a cash or 1\u20441000 of a tael)-money,\" because of the original rate of levy. The likin is professedly not an imperial customsduty, but a provincial tax levied by the governors of the provinces, and at their discretion as to amount; hence varying in local rate, and from time to time changeable. This has been a chief difficulty in carrying out the Chefoo Agreement, which as yet has never been authoritatively interpreted or finally ratified by England. [It was ratified in 1886. For the conditions of the Agreement see Ball, Things Chinese, 3rd ed. 629 seqq.] We quote the article of the Agreement which deals with opium, which has involved the chief difficulties, as leaving not only the amount to be paid, but the line at which this is to be paid, undefined.\n 1876. -- \"Sect. III. . . . (iii). On Opium Sir Thomas Wade will move his Government to sanction an arrangement different from that affecting other imports. British merchants, when opium is brought into port, will be obliged to have it taken cognizance of by the Customs, and deposited in Bond . . . until such time as there is a sale for it. The importer will then pay the tariff duty upon it, and the purchasers the likin: in order to the prevention of the evasion of the duty.

This plant-name is eventually to be identified with anil (q.v.), and with the Skt. n\u012bla, 'of a dark colour (especially dark blue or black)'; a fact which might be urged in favour of the view that the ancients in Asia, as has been alleged of them in Europe, belonged to the body of the colour-blind (like the writer of this article). The Indian word takes, in the sense of indigo, in Persian the form l\u012blang; in Ar. this, modified into l\u012blak and l\u012bl\u0101k, is applied to the lilac (Syringa spp.). Marcel Devic says the Ar. adj. l\u012blak has the modified sense 'bleua\u0302tre.' See a remark under BUCKYNE. We may note that in Scotland the 'striving after meaning' gives this familiar and beautiful tree the name among the uneducated of 'lily-oak.'\n", "lime": "s. The fruit of the small Citrus medica, var. acida, Hooker, is that generally called lime in India, approaching as it does very nearly to the fruit of the West India Lime. It is often not much bigger than a pigeon's egg, and one well-known miniature lime of this kind is called by the natives from its thin skin k\u0101ghaz\u012b n\u012bmb\u016b, or 'paper lime.' This seems to bear much the same relation to the lemon that the miniature thinskinned orange, which in London shops is called Tangerine, bears to the \"China orange.\" But lime is also used with the characterising adjective for the Citrus medica, var. Limetta, Hooker, or Sweet Lime, an insipid fruit.\n The word no doubt comes from the Sp. and Port. lima, which is from the Ar. l\u012bma; Fr. lime, Pers. l\u012bm\u016b, l\u012bm\u016bn (see LEMON). But probably it came into English from the Portuguese in India. It is not in Minsheu (2nd ed. 1727).\n 1404. -- \"And in this land of Guilan snow never falls, so hot is it; and it produces abundance of citrons and limes and oranges (cidras \u00e9 limas \u00e9 naranjas).\" -- Clavijo, \u0015lxxxvi.\n c. 1526. -- \"Another is the lime (l\u012bm\u016b), which is very plentiful.

Mahr. Li\u00f1g\u0101-\u012bt, Can. Ling\u0101yata, a member of a \u015aivaite sect in W. and S.

This is still their practice.\n Lingua is given as the name or title of the King of Columbum (see QUILON) in the 14th century, by Friar Jordanus (p. 41), which might have been taken to denote that he belonged to this sect; but this seems never to have had followers in Malabar.\n", "lingam": "s. This is taken from the S. Indian form of the word, which in N. India is Skt. and Hind. li\u00f1ga, 'a token, badge,' &c., thence the symbol of \u015aiva which is so extensively an object of worship among the Hindus, in the form of a cylinder of stone. The great idol of Somn\u0101th, destroyed by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, and the object of so much romantic narrative, was a colossal symbol of this kind. In the quotation of 1838 below, the word is used simply for a badge of caste, which is certainly the original Skt. meaning, but is probably a mistake as attributed in that sense to modern vernacular use. The man may have been a lingait (q.v.), so that his badge was actually a figure of the lingam. But this clever authoress often gets out of her depth.\n 1311. -- \"The stone idols called Ling Mah\u00e1deo, which had been a long time established at that place . . . these, up to this time, the kick of the horse of Islam had not attempted to break. . . .

[See CADJAN.] [Mr. Skeat notes that Klinkert gives -- \"Lontar, metathesis of ron-tal, leaf of the tal tree, a fanpalm whose leaves were once used for writing on, borassus flabelliformis.\" Ron is thus probably equivalent to the Malay daun, or in some dialects don, 'leaf.'

Every day their dinner is elegantly set out. Having eaten their fill it is said that they return to their parents in the woods in an orderly manner, and never hurt anybody that they meet by the way.\" -- Aelian, De Nat. Animal. xvi. 10.\n 1825. -- \"An alarm was given by one of the sentries in consequence of a baboon drawing near his post. The character of the intruder was, however, soon detected by one of the Suwarrs, who on the Sepoy's repeating his exclamation of the broken English 'Who goes 'ere?' said with a laugh, 'Why do you challenge the lungoor? he cannot answer you.'\" -- Heber, ii. 85.\n 1859. -- \"I found myself in immediate proximity to a sort of parliament or general assembly of the largest and most human-like monkeys I had ever seen. There were at least 200 of them, great lungoors, some quite four feet high, the jetty black of their faces enhanced by a fringe of snowy whisker.\" -- Lewin, A Fly on the Wheel, 49.\n 1884. -- \"Less interesting personally than the gibbon, but an animal of very developed social instincts, is Semnopithecus entellus, otherwise the Bengal langur. (He) fights for his wives according to a custom not unheard of in other cases; but what is peculiar to him is that the vanquished males 'receive charge of all the young ones of their own sex, with whom they retire to some neighbouring jungle.' Schoolmasters and private tutors will read this with interest, as showing the origin and early disabilities of their profession.\" -- Saturday Rev., May 31, on Sterndale's Nat. Hist. of Mammalia of India, &c.\n", "lungooty": "s. Hind. lango\u1e6d\u012b. The original application of this word seems to be the scantiest modicum of covering worn for decency by some of the lower classes when at work, and tied before and behind by a string round the waist; but it is sometimes applied to the more ample dhot\u012b (see DHOTY). According to R. Drummond, in Guzerat the \"Langoth or Lungota\" (as he writes) is \"a pretty broad piece of cotton cloth, tied round the breech by men and boys bathing. . . . The diminutive is Langotee, a long slip of cloth, stitched to a loin band of the same stuff, and forming exactly the T bandage of English Surgeons. . . .\" This distinction is probably originally correct, and the use of lang\u016bta by Abdurrazz\u0101k would agree with it. The use of the word has spread to some of the Indo-Chinese countries. In the quotation from Mocquet it is applied in speaking of an American Indian near the R. Amazon. But the writer had been in India.\n c. 1422. -- \"The blacks of this country have the body nearly naked; they wear only bandages round the middle called lankoutah, which descend from the navel to above the knee.\" -- Abdurrazz\u0101k, in India in XV. Cent. 17.\n 1526. -- \"Their peasants and the lower classes all go about naked. They tie on a thing which they call a langoti, which is a piece of clout that hangs down two spans from the navel, as a cover to their nakedness. Below this pendant modesty-clout is another slip of cloth, one end of which they fasten before to a string that ties on the langoti, and then passing the slip of cloth between the two legs, bring it up and fix it to the string of the langoti behind.\" -- Baber, 333.\n c. 1609. -- \"Leur capitaine auoit fort bonne fa\u00e7on, encore qu'il fust tout nud et luy seul auoit vn langoutin, qui est vne petite pi\u00e8ce de coton peinte.\" -- Mocquet, 77.\n 1653. -- \"Langouti est une pi\u00e8ce de linge dont les Indou se seruent \u00e0 cacher les parties naturelles.\" -- De la Boullaye-le-Gouz, ed. 1657, p. 547.\n [1822. -- \"The boatmen go nearly naked, seldom wearing more than a langutty. . . .\" -- Wallace, Fifteen Years in India, 410.]\n 1869. -- \"Son costume se compose, comme celui de tous les Cambodgiens, d'une veste courte et d'un langouti.\" -- Rev. des Deux Mondes, lxxix. 854.\n \"They wear nothing but the langoty, which is a string round the loins, and a piece of cloth about a hand's breadth fastened to it in front.\" -- (Ref. lost), p. 26.\n", "lunka": "n.p. Skt. La\u00f1ka. The oldest name of Ceylon in the literature both of Buddhism and Brahmanism. Also 'an island' in general.\n  --- , s.
