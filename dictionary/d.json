Singhalese d\u0101gaba, from Pali dh\u0101tugabbha, and Sansk. dh\u0101tu-garbha, 'Relic-receptacle'; applied to any dome-like Buddhist shrine (see TOPE, PAGODA). Gen. Cunningham alleges that the Chaitya was usually an empty tope dedicated to the Adi-Buddha (or Supreme, of the quasi-Theistic Buddhists), whilst the term Dh\u0101tu-garbha, or Dhagoba, was properly applied only to a tope which was an actual relic-shrine, or repository of ashes of the dead (Bhilsa Topes, 9). [\"The Shan word 'Htat,' or 'Tat,' and the Siamese 'Sat - oop,' for a pagoda placed over portions of Gaudama's body, such as his flesh, teeth, and hair, is derived from the Sanskrit 'Dh\u0101tu-garba,' a relic shrine\" (Hallett, A Thousand Miles, 308).]\n We are unable to say who first introduced the word into European use. It was well known to William von Humboldt, and to Ritter; but it has become more familiar through its frequent occurrence in Fergusson's Hist. of Architecture.

A name often given by old European travellers to the place now called Rangoon, from the great Relic-shrine or dagoba there, called Shw\u00e9 (Golden) Dag\u00f4n. Some have suggested that it is a corruption of dagoba, but this is merely guesswork. In the Talaing language t\u0103'kk\u016bn signifies 'athwart,' and, after the usual fashion, a legend had grown up connecting the name with the story of a tree lying 'athwart the hill-top,' which supernaturally indicated where the sacred relics of one of the Buddhas had been deposited (see J.A.S.B. xxviii. 477). Prof. Forchhammer recently (see Notes on Early Hist. and Geog. of B. Burma, No. 1) explained the true origin of the name. Towns lying near the sacred site had been known by the successive names of Asita\u00f1\u00f1a-nagara and Ukkalanagara. In the 12th century the last name disappears and is replaced by Trikumbha - nagara, or in Pali form Tikumbha - nagara, signifying '3-Hillcity.'* The Kaly\u0101ni inscription near Pegu contains both forms. Tikumbha gradually in popular utterance became Tikum, T\u0103kum, and T\u0103kun, whence Dag\u00f4n. The classical name of the great Dagoba is Tikumbha-cheti, and this is still in daily Burman use. Kumbha means an earthen pot, and also the \"frontal globe on the upper part of the forehead of the elephant.\" The latter meaning was, according to Prof. Forchhammer, that intended, being applied to the hillocks on which the town stood, because of their form. But the Burmese applied it to 'alms-bowls,' and invented a legend of Buddha and his two disciples having buried their alms-bowls at this spot.\n When the original meaning of the word T\u0103kum had been effaced from the memory of the Talaings, they invented the fable alluded to above in connection with the word t\u0103'kk\u016bn. [This view has been disputed by Col. Temple (Ind. Ant., Jan. 1893, p. 27). He gives the reading of the Kaly\u0101ni inscription as Tigumpanagara and goes on to say: \"There is more in favour of this derivation (from dagoba) than of any other yet produced. Thus we have d\u0101gaba, Singhalese, admittedly from dh\u0101tugabbha, and as far back as the 16th century we have a persistent word tigumpa or digumpa (dagon, digon) in Burma with the same meaning. Until a clear derivation is made out, it is, therefore, not unsafe to say that dagon represents some medieval Indian current form of dh\u0101tugabbha. This view is supported by a word gompa, used in the Him\u0101layas about Sikkim for a Buddhist shrine, which looks prima\u0302 facie like the remains of some such word as gabbha, the latter half of the compound dh\u0101tugabbha. . . . Neither Trikumbha-nagara in Skt. nor Tikumbha-nagara in Pali would mean 'Three-hill-city,' kumbha being in no sense a 'hill' which is k\u016bta, and there are not three hills on the site of the Shwe-Dagon Pagoda at Rangoon.\"]\n c. 1546. -- \"He hath very certaine intelligence, how the Zemindoo hath raised an army, with an intent to fall upon the Towns of Cosmin and Dalaa (DALA), and to gain all along the rivers of Digon and Meidoo, the whole Province of Danapluu, even to Ansedaa (hod.

Originally an actual copper coin, regarding which we find the following in the \u0100\u012bn, i. 31, ed. Blochmann: -- \"1. The D\u00e1m weighs 5 t\u00e1nks, i.e. 1 tolah, 8 m\u0101shas, and 7 surkhs; it is the fortieth part of a rupee. At first this coin was called Paisah, and also Bahloli; now it is known under this name (d\u00e1m). On one side the place is given where it was struck, on the other the date. For the purpose of calculation, the d\u00e1m is divided into 25 parts, each of which is called a j\u00e9tal. This imaginary division is only used by accountants.\n \"2. The adhelah is half of a d\u00e1m. 3. The P\u00e1ulah is a quarter of a d\u00e1m. 4. The damr\u00ed is an eighth of a d\u00e1m.\"\n It is curious that Akbar's revenues were registered in this small currency, viz. in laks of d\u00e1ms. We may compare the Portuguese use of reis [see REAS].\n The tendency of denominations of coins is always to sink in value. The jetal [see JEETUL], which had become an imaginary money of account in Akbar's time, was, in the 14th century, a real coin, which Mr. E. Thomas, chief of Indian numismatologists, has unearthed [see Chron. Pathan Kings, 231]. And now the d\u0101m itself is imaginary. According to Elliot the people of the N.W.P. not long ago calculated 25 d\u0101ms to the pais\u0101, which would be 1600 to a rupee. Carnegy gives the Oudh popular currency table as:\n 26 kauris = 1 damr\u012b 1 damr\u012b = 3 d\u0101m 20 damr\u012b = 1 \u0101n\u0101 25 d\u0101m = 1 pice.\n But the Calcutta Glossary says the d\u0101m is in Bengal reckoned 1\u204420 of an \u0101n\u0101, i.e. 320 to the rupee. [\"Most things of little value, here as well as in Bhagalpur (writing of Behar) are sold by an imaginary money called Tak\u0101, which is here reckoned equal to two Paysas. There are also imaginary monies called Chad\u0101m and Damr\u012b; the former is equal to 1 Paysa or 25 cowries, the latter is equal to one-eighth of a Paysa\" (Buchanan, Eastern Ind. i. 382 seq.)]. We have not in our own experience met with any reckoning of d\u0101ms. In the case of the damr\u012b the denomination has increased instead of sinking in relation to the d\u0101m. For above we have the damr\u012b=3 d\u0101ms, or according to Elliot (Beames, ii. 296)= 3\u00bc d\u0101ms, instead of \u215b of a d\u0101m as in Akbar's time. But in reality the damr\u012b's absolute value has remained the same. For by Carnegy's table 1 rupee or 16 anas would be equal to 320 damr\u012bs, and by the \u0100\u012bn, 1 rupee =40x8 damr\u012bs=320 damr\u012bs. Damr\u012b is a common enough expression for the infinitesimal in coin, and one has often heard a Briton in India say: \"No, I won't give a dumree!\" with but a vague notion what a damr\u012b meant, as in Scotland we have heard, \"I won't give a plack,\" though certainly the speaker could not have stated the value of that ancient coin. And this leads to the suggestion that a like expression, often heard from coarse talkers in England as well as in India, originated in the latter country, and that whatever profanity there may be in the animus, there is none in the etymology, when such an one blurts out \"I don't care a d\u0101m!\" i.e. in other words, \"I don't care a brass farthing!\"\n If the Gentle Reader deems this a far-fetched suggestion, let us back it by a second. We find in Chaucer (The Miller's Tale):\n \" --- ne raught he not a kers,\"\n which means, \"he recked not a cress\" (ne flocci quidem); an expression which is also found in Piers Plowman:\n \"Wisdom and witte is nowe not worthe a kerse.\"\n And this we doubt not has given rise to that other vulgar expression, \"I don't care a curse\"; -- curiously parallel in its corruption to that in illustration of which we quote it.\n [This suggestion about d\u0101m was made by a writer in Asiat. Res., ed. 1803, vii. 461: \"This word was perhaps in use even among our forefathers, and may innocently account for the expression 'not worth a fig,' or a dam, especially if we recollect that ba-dam, an almond, is to-day current in some parts of India as small money. Might not dried figs have been employed anciently in the same way, since the Arabic word fooloos, a halfpenny, also denotes a cassia bean, and the root fuls means the scale of a fish. Mankind are so apt, from a natural depravity, that 'flesh is heir to,' in their use of words, to pervert them from their original sense, that it is not a convincing argument against the present conjecture our using the word curse in vulgar language in lieu of dam.\" The N.E.D. disposes of the matter: \"The suggestion is ingenious, but has no basis in fact.\" In a letter to Mr. Ellis, Macaulay writes: \"How they settle the matter I care not, as the Duke says, one twopenny damn\"; and Sir G. Trevelyan notes: \"It was the Duke of Wellington who invented this oath, so disproportioned to the greatness of its author.\" (Life, ed. 1878, ii. 257.)]\n 1628. -- \"The revenue of all the territories under the Emperors of Delhi amounts, according to the Royal registers, to 6 arbs and 30 krors of d\u00e1ms.

Charles Elliot in China), added that, however, many of the party were angry with it; to which the Duke replied, -- 'I know they are, and I don't care a damn. I have no time to do what is right.'\n \"A twopenny damn was, I believe, the form usually employed by the Duke, as an expression of value: but on the present occasion he seems to have been less precise. \" -- Autobiography of Sir Henry Taylor, i. 296.

The word appears to be MalayoJavanese damar, used generically for resins, a class of substances the origin of which is probably often uncertain. [Mr. Skeat notes that the Malay damar means rosin and a torch made of rosin, the latter consisting of a regular cylin drical case, made of bamboo or other suitable material, filled to the top with rosin and ignited.] To one of the dammer-producing trees in the Archipelago the name Dammara alba, Rumph. (N. O. Coniferae), has been given, and this furnishes the 'East India Dammer' of English varnishmakers. In Burma the dammer used is derived from at least three different genera of the N. O. Dipterocarpeae; in Bengal it is derived from the s\u0101l tree (see SAUL-WOOD) (Shorea robusta) and other Shoreae, as well as by importation from transmarine sources. In S. India \"white dammer,\" \"Dammer Pitch,\" or Piney resin, is the produce of Vateria indica, and \"black dammer\" of Canarium strictum; in Cutch the dammer used is stated by Lieut. Leech (Bombay Selections, No. xv. p. 215-216) to be made from chandr\u016bz (or chandras =copal) boiled with an equal quantity of oil. This is probably Fryer's 'rosin taken out of the sea' (infra). [On the other hand Mr. Pringle (Diary, &c., Fort St. George, 1st ser. iv. 178) quotes Crawfurd (Malay Archip. i. 455): (Dammer) \"exudes through the bark, and is either found adhering to the trunk and branches in large lumps, or in masses on the ground, under the trees. As these often grow near the sea-side or on banks of rivers, the damar is frequently floated away and collected at different places as drift\"; and adds: \"The dammer used for caulking the masula boats at Madras when Fryer was there, may have been, and probably was, imported from the Archipelago, and the fact that the resin was largely collected as drift may have been mentioned in answer to his enquiries.\"] Some of the Malay dammer also seems, from Major M'Nair's statement, to be, like copal, fossil. [On this Mr. Skeat says: \"It is true that it is sometimes dug up out of the ground, possibly because it may form on the roots of certain trees, or because a great mass of it will fall and partially bury itself in the ground by its own weight, but I have never heard of its being found actually fossilised, and I should question the fact seriously.\"]\n The word is sometimes used in India [and by the Malays, see above] for 'a torch,' because torches are formed of rags dipped in it. This is perhaps the use which accounts for Haex's explanation below.\n 1584. -- \"Demnar (for demmar) from Siacca and Blinton\" (i.e. Siak and Billiton). -- Barret, in Hakl. ii. 43.\n 1631. -- In Haex's Malay Vocabulary: \"Damar, Lumen quod accenditur.\"\n 1673. -- \"The Boat is not strengthened with Knee-Timbers as ours are, the bended Planks are sowed together with Rope-yarn of the Cocoe, and calked with Dammar (a sort of Rosin taken out of the sea).\" -- Fryer, 37.\n \" \"The long continued Current from the Inland Parts (at Surat) through the vast Wildernesses of huge Woods and Forests, wafts great Rafts of Timber for Shipping and Building: and Damar for Pitch, the finest sented Bitumen (if it be not a gum or Rosin) I ever met with.\" -- Ibid. 121.\n 1727. -- \"Damar, a gum that is used for making Pitch and Tar for the use of Shipping. \" -- A.

This substance, as is well known, is the resin which exudes from notches made in various species of coniferous and dipterocarpous trees . . . out of whose stem . . . the native cuts large notches up to a height of 40 or 50 feet from the ground. The tree is then left for 3 or 4 months when, if it be a very healthy one, sufficient dammar will have exuded to make it worth while collecting; the yield may then be as much as 94 Amsterdam pounds.\" -- H.

The etymology of the term \u1e0ch\u0101ngar is doubtful. The late Gen.

A famous sanitarium in the Eastern Him\u0101laya, the cession of which was purchased from the Raja of Sikkim in 1835; a tract largely added to by annexation in 1849, following on an outrage committed by the Sikkim Minister in imprisoning Dr. (afterwards Sir) Joseph Hooker and the late Dr. A. Campbell, Superintendent of Darjeeling. The sanitarium stands at 6500 to 7500 feet above the sea. The popular Tibetan spelling of the name is, according to Jaeshcke, rDorrje-glin, 'Land of the Dorje,' i.e. 'of the Adamant or thunderbolt,' the ritual sceptre of the Lamas. But 'according to several titles of books in the Petersburg list of MSS. it ought properly to be spelt Dar-rgyas-glin' (Tib. Eng. Dict. p. 287).\n", "dar\u00f3ga": "s. P. and H. d\u0101rogh\u0101. This word seems to be originally Mongol (see Kovalevsky's Dict. No. 1672). In any case it is one of those terms brought by the Mongol hosts from the far East. In their nomenclature it was applied to a Governor of a province or city, and in this sense it continued to be used under Timur and his immediate successors. But it is the tendency of official titles, as of denominations of coin, to descend in value; and that of d\u0101rogh\u0101 has in later days been bestowed on a variety of humbler persons. Wilson defines the word thus: \"The chief native officer in various departments under the native government, a superintendent, a manager: but in later times he is especially the head of a police, customs, or excise station.\" Under the British Police system, from 1793 to 1862-63, the Darogha was a local Chief of Police, or Head Constable, [and this is still the popular title in the N.W.P. for the officer in charge of a Police Station.] The word occurs in the sense of a Governor in a Mongol inscription, of the year 1314, found in the Chinese Province of Shensi, which is given by Pauthier in his Marc. Pol., p. 773. The Mongol Governor of Moscow, during a part of the Tartar domination in Russia, is called in the old Russian Chronicles Doroga (see Hammer, Golden Horde, 384). And according to the same writer the word appears in a Byzantine writer (unnamed) as *DA/RHGAS (ibid. 238-9).

This word is used in old books of Travel and Trade for a steelyard employed in China and the Archipelago. It is given by Leyden as a Malay word for 'balance,' in his Comp. Vocab. of Barma, Malay and Thai, Serampore, 1810. It is also given by Crawfurd as \u1e0dachin, a Malay word from the Javanese. There seems to be no doubt that in Peking dialect ch'eng is 'to weigh,' and also 'steelyard'; that in Amoy a small steelyard is called ch'in; and that in Canton dialect the steelvard is called t'okch'ing. Some of the Dictionaries also give ta 'ch\u00eang, 'large steelyard.' Datchin or dotchin may therefore possibly be a Chinese term; but considering how seldom traders' words are really Chinese, and how easily the Chinese monosyllables lend themselves to plausible combinations, it remains probable that the Canton word was adopted from foreigners. It has sometimes occurred to us that it might have been adopted from Achin (d'Achin); see the first quotation. [The N.E.D., following Prof. Giles, gives it as a corruption of the Cantonese name toh-ch'ing (in Court dialect toch'\u00eang) from toh 'to measure,' ch'ing, 'to weigh.' Mr. Skeat notes: \"The standard Malay is daching, the Javanese dachin (v. Klinkert, s.v.). He gives the word as of Chinese origin, and the probability is that the English word is from the Malay, which in its turn was borrowed from the Chinese. The final suggestion, d'Achin, seems out of the question.] Favre's Malay Dict. gives (in French) \"daxing (Ch. pa-tchen), steelyard, balance,\" also \"ber- daxing, to weigh,\" and Javan. \"daxin, a weight of 100 k\u0101tis.\" Gericke's Javan. Dict. also gives \"datsin-Picol,\" with a reference to Chinese. [With reference to Crawfurd's statement quoted above, Mr. Pringle (Diary, Ft. St. George, 1st ser. iv. 179) notes that Crawfurd had elsewhere adopted the view that the yard and the designation of it originated in China and passed from thence to the Archipelago (Malay Archip. i. 275). On the whole, the Chinese origin seems most probable.]\n 1554. -- At Malacca. \"The baar of the great Dachem contains 200 cates, each cate weighing two arratels, 4 ounces, 5 eighths, 15 grains, 3 tenths. . . .

The word is not Anglo-Indian, but it is introduced here because it has been supposed to be the corruption of an Oriental word, and suggested to have been taken from the name of Damagh\u0101n in Persia. This looks plausible (compare the Persian origin of carboy, which is another name for just the same thing), but no historical proof has yet been adduced, and it is doubted by Mr. Marsh in his Notes on Wedgwood's Dictionary, and by Dozy (Sup. aux Dict. Arabes). It may be noticed, as worthy of further enquiry, that Sir T. Herbert (192) speaks of the abundance and cheapness of wine at Damagh\u0101n. Niebuhr, however, in a passage quoted below, uses the word as an Oriental one, and in a note on the 5th ed. of Lane's Mod. Egyptians, 1860, p. 149, there is a remark quoted from Hammer-Purgstall as to the omission from the detail of domestic vessels of two whose names have been adopted in European languages, viz. the garra or jarra, a water 'jar,' and the demig\u0101n or demij\u0101n, 'la damejeanne.

The name applied to a kind of fever. The term is of West Indian, not East Indian, origin, and has only become known and familiar in India within the last 30 years or more. The origin of the name which seems to be generally accepted is, that owing to the stiff unbending carriage which the fever induced in those who suffered from it, the negroes in the W. Indies gave it the name of 'dandy fever'; and this name, taken up by the Spaniards, was converted into dengy or dengue. [But according to the N.E.D. both 'dandy' and 'dengue' are corruptions of the Swahili term, ka dinga pepo, 'sudden cramp-like seizure by an evil spirit.'] Some of its usual characteristics are the great suddenness of attack; often a red eruption; pain amounting sometimes to anguish in head and back, and shifting pains in the joints; excessive and sudden prostration; afterpains of rheumatic character. Its epidemic occurrences are generally at long intervals.\n Omitting such occurrences in America and in Egypt, symptoms attach to an epidemic on the Coromandel coast about 1780 which point to this disease; and in 1824 an epidemic of the kind caused much alarm and suffering in Calcutta, Berhampore, and other places in India. This had no repetition of equal severity in that quarter till 1871-72, though there had been a minor visitation in 1853, and a succession of cases in 1868-69. In 1872 it was so prevalent in Calcutta that among those in the service of the E. I. Railway Company, European and native, prior to August in that year, 70 per cent. had suffered from the disease; and whole households were sometimes attacked at once. It became endemic in Lower Bengal for several seasons. When the present writer (H. Y.) left India (in 1862) the name dengue may have been known to medical men, but it was quite unknown to the lay European public.\n 1885. -- THE CONTAGION OF DENGUE FEVER. \"In a recent issue (March 14th, p. 551) under the heading 'Dengue Fever in New Caledonia,' you remark that, although there had been upwards of nine hundred cases, yet, 'curiously enough,' there had not been one death. May I venture to say that the 'curiosity' would have been much greater had there been a death? For, although this disease is one of the most infectious, and as I can testify from unpleasant personal experience, one of the most painful that there is, yet death is a very rare occurrence. In an epidemic at Bermuda in 1882, in which about five hundred cases came under my observation, not one death was recorded. In that epidemic, which attacked both whites and blacks impartially, inflammation of the cellular tissue, affecting chiefly the face, neck, and scrotum, was especially prevalent as a sequela, none but the lightest cases escaping. I am not aware that this is noted in the text-books as a characteristic of the disease; in fact, the descriptions in the books then available to me, differed greatly from the disease as I then found it, and I believe that was the experience of other medical officers at the time. . . . During the epidemic of dengue above mentioned, an officer who was confined to his quarters, convalescing from the disease, wrote a letter home to his father in England. About three days after the receipt of the letter, that gentleman complained of being ill, and eventually, from his description, had a rather severe attack of what, had he been in Bermuda, would have been called dengue fever. As it was, his medical attendant was puzzled to give a name to it. The disease did not spread to the other members of the family, and the patient made a good recovery. -- Henry J. Barnes, Surgeon, Medical Staff, Fort Pitt, Chatham.\" From British Medical Journal, April 25.\n", "deodar": "s. The Cedrus deodara, Loud., of the Him\u0101laya, now known as an ornamental tree in England for some seventy-five years past. The finest specimens in the Him\u0101laya are often found in clumps shadowing a small temple. The Deodar is now regarded by botanists as a variety of Cedrus Libani. It is confined to the W. Him\u0101laya from Nep\u0101l to Afghanistan; it reappears as the Cedar of Lebanon in Syria, and on through Cyprus and Asia Minor; and emerges once more in Algeria, and thence westwards to the Riff Mountains in Morocco, under the name of C. Atlantica.  The word occurs in Avicenna, who speaks of the Deiudar as yielding a kind of turpentine (see below). We may note that an article called Deodarwood Oil appears in Dr. Forbes Watson's \"List of Indian Products\" (No. 2941) [and see Watt, Econ. Dict. ii. 235].\n Deodar is by no means the universal name of the great Cedar in the Him\u0101lay. It is called so (Dewd\u0101r, Di\u0101r, or Dy\u0101r [Drew, Jummoo, 100]) in Kashm\u012br, where the deod\u0101r pillars of the great mosque of Srinagar date from A.D. 1401. The name, indeed (devad\u0101ru, 'timber of the gods'), is applied in different parts of India to different trees, and even in the Him\u0101laya to more than one. The list just referred to (which however has not been revised critically) gives this name in different modifications as applied also to the pencil Cedar (Juniperus excelsa), to Guatteria (or Uvaria) longifolia, to Sethia Indica, to Erythroxylon areolatum, and (on the R\u0101v\u012b and Sutlej) to Cupressus torulosa.\n The Deod\u0101r first became known to Europeans in the beginning of the last century, when specimens were sent to Dr. Roxburgh, who called it a Pinus. Seeds were sent to Europe by Capt. Gerard in 1819; but the first that grew were those sent by the Hon. W. Leslie Melville in 1822.\n c. 1030. -- \"Deiudar (or rather Diudar) est ex genere abhel (i.e. juniper) quae dicitur pinus Inda, et Syr deiudar (Milk of Deodar) est ejus lac (turpentine).\" -- Avicenna, Lat.

This phrase is a literal translation of bh\u016bta-p\u016bj\u0101, i.e. worship of bh\u016btas [see BHOOT], a word which appears in slightly differing forms in various languages of India, including the Tamil country. A bh\u016bta, or as in Tamil more usually, p\u0113y, is a malignant being which is conceived to arise from the person of anyone who has come to a violent death. This superstition, in one form or another, seems to have formed the religion of the Dravidian tribes of S. India before the introduction of Brahmanism, and is still the real religion of nearly all the low castes in that region, whilst it is often patronized also by the higher castes. These superstitions, and especially the demonolatrous rites called 'devil-dancing,' are identical in character with those commonly known as Shamanism [see SHAMAN], and which are spread all over Northern Asia, among the red races of America, and among a vast variety of tribes in Ceylon and in Indo-China, not excluding the Burmese. A full account of the demonworship of Tinnevelly was given by Bp. Caldwell in a small pamphlet on the \"Tinnevelly Shanars\" (Madras 1849), and interesting evidence of its identity with the Shamanism of other regions will be found in his Comparative Grammar (2nd ed. 579 seqq.); see also Marco Polo, 2nd ed. ii. 79 seq.; [Oppert.

The chief meanings of this word in Anglo-Indian usage are:\n ments which preceded us, \"the head financial minister, whether of the state or a province . . . charged, in the latter, with the collection of the revenue, the remittance of it to the imperial treasury, and invested with extensive judicial powers in all civil and financial causes\" (Wilson). It was in this sense that the grant of the Dewauny (q.v.) to the E. I. Company in 1765 became the foundation of the British Empire in India. (2) The prime minister of a native State. (3) The chief native officer of certain Government establishments, such as the Mint; or the native manager of a Zemindary. (4) (In Bengal) a native servant in confidential charge of the dealings of a house of business with natives, or of the affairs of a large domestic establishment. These meanings are perhaps all reducible to one conception, of which 'Steward' would be an appropriate expression. But the word has had many other ramifications of meaning, and has travelled far.\n The Arabian d\u012bw\u0101n is, according to Lane, an Arabicized word of Persian origin (though some hold it for pure Arabic), and is in original meaning nearly equivalent to Persian daftar (see DUFTER), i.e. a collection of written leaves or sheets (forming a book for registration); hence 'a register of accounts'; a 'register of soldiers or pensioners'; a 'register of the rights or dues of the State, or relating to the acts of government, the finances and the administration'; also any book, and especially a collection of the poems of some particular poet. It was also applied to signify 'an account'; then a 'writer of accounts'; a 'place of such writers of accounts'; also a 'council, court, or tribunal'; and in the present day, a 'long seat formed of a mattress laid along the wall of a room, with cushions, raised or on the floor'; or 'two or more of such seats.' Thus far (in this paragraph) we abstract from Lane.\n The Arabian historian Bil\u0101dur\u012b (c. 860) relates as to the first introduction of the d\u012bw\u0101n that, when 'Omar was discussing with the people how to divide the enormous wealth derived from the conquests in his time, Wal\u012bd bin Hish\u0101m bin Moghaira said to the caliph, 'I have been in Syria, and saw that its kings make a d\u012bw\u0101n; do thou the like.' So 'Omar accepted his advice, and sent for two men of the Persian tongue, and said to them: 'Write down the people according to their rank' (and corresponding pensions).*\n We must observe that in the Mahommedan States of the Mediterranean the word d\u012bw\u0101n became especially applied to the Custom-house, and thus passed into the Romance languages as aduana, douane, dogana, &c. Littr\u00e9 indeed avoids any decision as to the etymology of douane, &c. And Hyde (Note on Abr. Peritsol, in Syntagma Dissertt. i. 101) derives dogana from doca\u0302n (i.e. P. duk\u0101n, 'officina, a shop'). But such passages as that below from Ibn Jubair, and the fact that, in the medieval Florentine treaties with the Mahommedan powers of Barbary and Egypt, the word d\u012bw\u0101n in the Arabic texts constantly represents the dogana of the Italian, seem sufficient to settle the question (see Amari, Diplomi Arabi del Real Archivio, &c.; e.g. p. 104, and (Latin) p. 305, and in many other places).\u2020 The Spanish Dict. of Cobarruvias (1611) quotes Urrea as saying that, \"from the Arabic noun Diuanum, which signifies the house where the duties are collected, we form diuana, and thence adiuana, and lastly aduana.\"\n At a later date the word was reimported into Europe in the sense of a hall furnished with Turkish couches and cushions, as well as of a couch of this kind. Hence we get cigar-divans, et hoc genus omne. The application to certain collections of poems is noticed above. It seems to be especially applied to assemblages of short poems of homogeneous character. Thus the Odes of Horace, the Sonnets of Petrarch, the In Memoriam of Tennyson, answer to the character of D\u012bw\u0101n so used. Hence also Goethe took the title of his West-\u00d6stliche Diwan.\n c. A. D. 636. -- \". . . in the Caliphate of Omar the spoil of Syria and Persia began in We owe this quotation, as well as that below from Ibn Jubair, to the kindness of Prof. Robertson Smith. On the proceedings of 'Omar see also Sir Wm. Muir's Annals of the Early Caliphate in the chapter quoted below.\n At p. 6 there is an Arabic letter, dated A.D. 1200, from Abdurrahm\u0101n ibn 'Ali T\u0101hir, 'al-nazir ba-d\u012bw\u0101n Ifri\u1e33iya,' inspector of the dogana of Africa. But in the Latin version this appears as Rector omnium Christianorum qui veniunt in totam provinciam de Africa (p. 276). In another letter, without date, from Yusuf ibn Mahommed S\u0101hib diw\u0101n Tunis wal-Mahdia, Amari renders 'preposto della dogana di Tunis,' &c.

What was easy in small beginnings by equal sharing or discretionary preference, became now a heavy task. . . . At length, in the 2nd or 3rd year of his Caliphate, Omar determined that the distribution should be regulated on a fixed and systematic scale. . . . To carry out this vast design, a Register had to be drawn and kept up of every man, woman, and child, entitled to a stipend from the State. . . .

[The derivation of the word from Skt. Pr\u0101chy\u0101s 'Inhabitants of the east country,' is supported by McCrindle, Ancient India, 365 seq.

It consists of a cot or frame, suspended by the four corners from a bamboo pole, and is carried by two or four men (see figure in Herklots, Qanoon-e-Islam, pl. vii. fig. 4). \u1e0coli is from \u1e0doln\u0101, 'to swing.' The word is also applied to the meat(or milk-) safe, which is usually slung to a tree, or to a hook in the verandah. As it is lighter and cheaper than a palankin it costs less both to buy or hire and to carry, and is used by the poorer classes. It also forms the usual ambulance of the Indian army. Hence the familiar story of the orator in Parliament who, in celebrating a battle in India, spoke of the \"ferocious Doolies rushing down from the mountain and carrying off the wounded\"; a story which, to our regret, we have not been able to verify.

The last seems the more correct, though not perhaps the more common. The term is common in Western India, and on various shores of the Arabian sea, and is used on the E. African coast for craft in general (see Burton, in J.R.G.S. xxix. 239); but in the mouths of Englishmen on the western seas of India it is applied specially to the old-fashioned vessel of Arab build, with a long grab stem, i.e. rising at a long slope from the water, and about as long as the keel, usually with one mast and lateen-rig. There are the lines of a dow, and a technical description, by Mr. Edie, in J. R. As. Soc., vol. i. p. 11. The slaving dow is described and illustrated in Capt. Colomb's Slave-catching in the Indian Ocean; see also Capt. W. F. Owen's Narrative (1833), p. 385, [i. 384 seq.]. Most people suppose the word to be Arabic, and it is in (Johnson's) Richardson (d\u0101o) as an Arabic word. But no Arabic scholar whom we have consulted admits it to be genuine Arabic. Can it possibly have been taken from Pers. dav, 'running'? [The N.E.D. remarks that if Tava (in Ath. Nikitin, below) be the same, it would tend to localise the word at Ormus in the Persian Gulf.] Capt. Burton identifies it with the word zabra applied in the Roteiro of Vasco's Voyage (p. 37) to a native vessel at Mombasa. But zabra or zavra was apparently a Basque name for a kind of craft in Biscay (see s.v. Bluteau, and the Dicc. de la Lingua Castel., vol. vi. 1739). D\u0101o or D\u0101va is indeed in Molesworth's Mahr. Dict. as a word in that language, but this gives no assurance of origin.

Traces of this custom in some form are found in many parts of the world, and Sir H. Maine (see below) has quoted a remarkable example from the Irish Brehon Laws.

It consists in sitting at the debtor's door and starving yourself till he pays. From the English point of view the practice has always been considered barbarous and immoral, and the Indian Penal Code expressly forbids it. It suggests, however, the question -- what would follow if the debtor simply allowed the creditor to starve? Undoubtedly the Hindoo supposes that some supernatural penalty would follow; indeed, he generally gives definiteness to it by retaining a Brahmin to starve himself vicariously, and no Hindoo doubts what would come of causing a Brahmin's death.\" -- Maine, Hist. of Early Institutions, 40.

After fasting three days in vain, they proceeded from dharn\u0101 to the further rite of tr\u0101g\u0101 (q.v.). Some hacked their own arms; others decapitated three old women of their party, and hung their heads up as a garland at the gate. Certain of the women cut off their own breasts.

But it was long before the rise of Isl\u0101m that the knowledge and name of the denarius as applied to a gold coin had reached India. The inscription on the east gate of the great tope at Sanchi is probably the oldest instance preserved, though the date of that is a matter greatly disputed. But in the Amarakosha (c. A.D. 500) we have 'd\u012bn\u0101re 'pi cha nishkah,' i.e. 'a nishkah (or gold coin) is the same as d\u012bn\u0101ra.' And in the Kalpas\u016btra of Bhadrab\u0101hu (of about the same age) \u0015 36, we have 'd\u012bn\u0101ra m\u0101laya,' 'a necklace of d\u012bn\u0101rs,' mentioned (see Max M\u00fcller below). The d\u012bn\u0101r in modern Persia is a very small imaginary coin, of which 10,000 make a tomaun (q.v.). In the Middle Ages we find Arabic writers applying the term d\u012bn\u0101r both to the staple gold coin (corresponding to the gold mohr of more modern times) and to the staple silver coin (corresponding to what has been called since the 16th century the rupee).

He appeals to the king to compare the Roman gold denarius (called by Cosmas NO/MIS MA), and the Persian silver drachma, both of which were at hand, and to judge for himself which suggested the greater monarch. \"Now the nomisma was a coin of right good ring and fine ruddy gold, bright in metal and elegant in execution, for such coins are picked on purpose to take thither, whilst the miliaresion (or drachma), to say it in one word, was of silver, and of course bore no comparison with the gold coin,\" &c.

A name by which Sind is often called in early European narratives, taken up by the authors, no doubt, like so many other prevalent names, from the Arab traders who had preceded them. Dewal or Daibul was a once celebrated city and seaport of Sind, mentioned by all the old Arabian geographers, and believed to have stood at or near the site of modern Kar\u0101ch\u012b. It had the name from a famous temple (dev\u0101lya), probably a Buddhist shrine, which existed there, and which was destroyed by the Mahommedans in 711. The name of Dewal long survived the city itself, and the specific addition of Sind or Sind\u012b being added, probably to distinguish it from some other place of resembling name, the name of Dewal-Sind or Sindi came to be attached to the delta of the Indus.\n c. 700. -- The earliest mention of Dewal that we are aware of is in a notice of Chinese Voyages to the Persian Gulf under the T'ang dynasty (7th and 8th centuries) quoted by Deguignes. In this the ships, after leaving Tiyu (Diu) sailed 10 days further to another Tiyu near the great river Milan or Sinteu.

It has a kind of analogy, as Thevenot pointed out over 200 years ago, to the old Norman Haro! Haro! viens \u00e0 mon aide, mon Prince!* but does not now carry the privilege of the Norman cry; though one may conjecture, both from Indian analogies and from the statement of Ibn Batuta quoted below, that it once did. Every Englishman in Upper India has often been saluted by the calls of, 'Doh\u0101i Khud\u0101wand k\u012b! Doh\u0101i Mah\u0101r\u0101j! Doh\u0101i Kompan\u012b Bah\u0101dur!' 'Justice, my Lord! Justice, O King! Justice, O Company!' -- perhaps in consequence of some oppression by his followers, perhaps in reference to some grievance with which he has no power to interfere. \"Until 1860 no one dared to ignore the appeal of doh\u0101\u012b to a native Prince within his territory. I have heard a serious charge made against a person for calling the doh\u0101\u012b needlessly\" (M.-Gen. Keatinge).\n It will be seen that the Indian cry also appeals to the Prince expressly. It was the good fortune of one of the present writers (A. B.) to have witnessed the call of Haro! brought into serious operation at Jersey.\n Wilson derives the exclamation from do, 'two' or repeatedly, and h\u0101i 'alas,' illustrating this by the phrase 'doh\u0101\u012b t\u012bh\u0101\u012b karn\u0101,' 'to make exclamation (or invocation of justice) twice and thrice.' [Platts says, do-h\u0101y, Skt. hr\u012b-h\u0101h\u0101,' a crying twice \"alas!\"] This phrase, however, we take to be merely an example of the 'striving after meaning,' usual in cases where the real origin of the phrase is forgotten. We cannot doubt that the word is really a form of the Skt. droha, 'injury, wrong.' And this is confirmed by the form in Ibn Batuta, and the Mahr. dur\u0101hi; \"an exclamation or expression used in prohibiting in the name of the Raja. . . implying an imprecation of his vengeance in case of disobedience\" (Molesworth's Dict.); also Tel. and Canar. dur\u0101i, 'protest, prohibition, caveat, or veto in arrest of proceedings' (Wilson and C. P. B., MS.)\n c. 1340. -- \"It is a custom in India that when money is due from any person who is favoured by the Sultan, and the creditor wants his debt settled, he lies in wait at the Palace gate for the debtor, and when the latter is about to enter he assails him with the exclamation Daro\u0304hai us - Sultan! 'O Enemy of the Sultan. -- I swear by the head of the King thou shalt not enter till thou hast paid me what thou owest.' The debtor cannot then stir from the spot, until he has satisfied the creditor, or has obtained his consent to the respite.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 412. The signification assigned to the words by the Moorish traveller probably only shows that the real meaning was unknown to his Musulman friends at Delhi, whilst its form strongly corroborates our etymology, and shows that it still kept close to the Sanskrit.\n 1609. -- \"He is severe enough, but all helpeth not; for his poore Riats or clownes complaine of Iniustice done them, and cry for justice at the King's hands.\" -- Hawkins, in Purchas, i. 223.\n c. 1666. -- \"Quand on y veut arr\u00eater une personne, on crie seulement Doa padecha; cette clameur a autant de force que celle de haro en Normandie; et si on defend \u00e0 quelqu'un de sortir, du lieu o\u00f9 il est, en disant Doa padecha, il ne peut partir sans se rendre criminel, et il est oblig\u00e9 de se presentir \u00e0 la Justice.\" -- Thevenot, v. 61.\n 1834. -- \"The servant woman began to make a great outcry, and wanted to leave the ship, and cried Dohaee to the Company, for she was murdered and kidnapped.\" -- The Baboo, ii. 242.\n", "doar": "n.p.

The proper meaning of \u1e0d\u0101l\u012b is a 'branch' or 'twig' (Skt. d\u0101r); then a 'basket,' a 'tray,' or a 'pair of trays slung to a yoke,' as used in making the offerings. Twenty years ago the custom of presenting \u1e0d\u0101l\u012bs was innocent and merely complimentary; but, if the letter quoted under 1882 is correct, it must have grown into a gross abuse, especially in the Punjab.

But it is perhaps connected with the Tamil tonduga, 'to scoop out'; and the word would then be exactly analogous to the Anglo-American 'dug-out.' In the J.R.A.S. vol. i. is a paper by Mr. Edye, formerly H.M.'s Master Shipwright in Ceylon, on the native vessels of South India, and among others he describes the Doni (p. 13), with a drawing to scale.

Some of them have tails weighing 10 and 20 pounds, and that will happen when they get fat of their own accord. But in Egypt many persons make a business of fattening sheep, and feed them on bran and wheat, and then the tail gets so big that the sheep can't stir. But those who keep them tie the tail on a kind of little cart, and in this way they move about. I saw one sheep's tail of this kind at Asiot, a city of Egypt 150 miles from Cairo, on the Nile, which weighed 80 lbs., and many people asserted that they have seen such tails that weighed 150 lbs.\" -- Leo Africanus, in Ramusio, i. f. 92v.\n [c. 1610. -- \"The tails of rams and ewes are wondrous big and heavy; one we weighed (in the Island of St. Lawrence) turned 28 pounds.\" -- Pyrard de Laval, i. 36.\n [1612. -- \"Goodly Barbary sheep with great rumps.\" -- Danvers, Letters, i. 178.]\n 1828. -- \"We had a Doomba ram at Prag.

O. Bombaceae) called by botanists Durio zibethinus, D. C. The tree appears to be a native of the Malay Peninsula, and the nearest islands; from which it has been carried to Tenasserim on one side and to Mindanao on the other.\n The earliest European mention of this fruit is that by Nicolo Conti. The passage is thus rendered by Winter Jones: \"In this island (Sumatra) there also grows a green fruit which they call duriano, of the size of a cucumber. When opened five fruits are found within, resembling oblong oranges. The taste varies like that of cheese.\" (In India in the XVth Cent., p. 9.) We give the original Latin of Poggio below, which must be more correctly rendered thus: \"They have a green fruit which they call durian, as big as a water-melon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, with a combination of flavours.\" (See Carletti, below).\n The dorian in Sumatra often forms a staple article of food, as the jack (q.v.) does in Malabar. By natives and old European residents in the Malay regions in which it is produced the dorian is regarded as incomparable, but novices have a difficulty in getting over the peculiar, strong, and offensive odour of the fruit, on account of which it is usual to open it away from the house, and which procured for it the inelegant Dutch nickname of stancker. \"When that aversion, however, is conquered, many fall into the taste of the natives, and become passionately fond of it.\" (Crawfurd, H. of Ind. Arch. i. 419.) [Wallace (Malay Arch. 57) says that he could not bear the smell when he \"first tried it in Malacca, but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater . . . the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact to eat Durians is a new sensation, worth a voyage to the East to experience. \"] Our forefathers had not such delicate noses, as may be gathered from some of the older notices.

Skt. da\u015bahar\u0101, H. dashar\u0101, Mahr. dasr\u0101; the nine-nights' (or ten days') festival in October, also called Durg\u0101-p\u016bj\u0101 (see DOORGA-P.). In the west and south of India this holiday, taking place after the close of the wet season, became a great military festival, and the period when military expeditions were entered upon. The Mahrattas were alleged to celebrate the occasion in a way characteristic of them, by destroying a village! The popular etymology of the word and that accepted by the best authorities, is da\u015b, 'ten (sins)' and har, 'that which takes away (or expiates).' It is, perhaps, rather connected with the ten days' duration of the feast, or with its chief day being the 10th of the month (A\u015bvina); but the origin is decidedly obscure.\n c. 1590. -- \"The autumn harvest he shall begin to collect from the Deshereh, which is another Hindoo festival that also happens differently, from the beginning of Virgo to the commencement of Libra.\" -- Ayeen, tr.

That commission or percentage on the money passing in any cash transaction which, with or without acknowledgment or permission, sticks to the fingers of the agent of payment. Such 'customary' appropriations are, we believe, very nearly as common in England as in India; a fact of which newspaper correspondence from time to time makes us aware, though Euro peans in India, in condemning the natives, often forget, or are ignorant of this. In India the practice is perhaps more distinctly recognised, as the word denotes. Ibn Batuta tells us that at the Court of Delhi, in his time (c. 1340), the custom was for the officials to deduct 1\u204410 of every sum which the Sultan ordered to be paid from the treasury (see I. B. pp. 408, 426, &c.).\n [1616. -- \"The dusturia in all bought goodes . . . is a great matter.\" -- Sir T. Roe, Hak.
