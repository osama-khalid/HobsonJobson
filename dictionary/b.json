A weight used in large trading transactions; it varied much in different localities; and though the name is of Indian origin it was naturalised by the Arabs, and carried by them to the far East, being found in use, when the Portuguese arrived in those seas, at least as far as the Moluccas. In the Indian islands the bah\u0101r is generally reckoned as equal to 3 peculs (q.v.), or 400 avoirdupois. But there was a different bah\u0101r in use for different articles of merchandise; or, rather, each article had a special surplus allowance in weighing, which practically made a different bah\u0101r (see PICOTA). [Mr. Skeat says that it is now uniformly equal to 400 lbs. av. in the British dominions in the Malay Peninsula; but Klinkert gives it as the equivalent of 12 pikuls of Agar-agar; 6 of cinnamon; 3 of Tripang.]\n 1498. -- \". . . and begged him to send to the King his Lord a bagar of cinnamon, and another of clove . . . for sample\" (a mostra). -- Roteiro de V. da Gama, 78.\n 1506. -- \"In Cananor el suo Re si \u00e8 zentil, e qui nasce zz.

This makes the barom equal to 650 lbs.]\n", "bahaudur": "s. H. Bah\u0101dur, 'a hero, or champion.' It is a title affixed commonly to the names of European officers in Indian documents, or when spoken of ceremoniously by natives (e.g. \"Jones S\u0101hib Bah\u0101dur\"), in which use it may be compared with \"the gallant officer\" of Parliamentary courtesy, or the Illustrissimo Signore of the Italians. It was conferred as a title of honour by the Great Mogul and by other native princes [while in Persia it was often applied to slaves (Burton, Ar. Nights, iii. 114)]. Thus it was particularly affected to the end of his life by Hyder Ali, to whom it had been given by the Raja of Mysore (see quotation from John Lindsay below [and Wilks, Mysoor, Madras reprint, i. 280]). Bah\u0101dur and Sird\u0101r Bah\u0101dur are also the official titles of members of the 2nd and 1st classes respectively of the Order of British India, established for native officers of the army in 1837. [The title of R\u0101\u0113 Bah\u0101dur is also conferred upon Hindu civil officers.]\n As conferred by the Court of Delhi the usual gradation of titles was (ascending): -- 1. Bah\u0101dur; 2. Bah\u0101dur Jang; 3. Bah\u0101dur ud-Daulah; 4. Bah\u0101dur ul-mulk. At Hyderabad they had also Bah\u0101dur ul-Umr\u0101 (Kirkpatrick, in Tippoo's Letters, 354). [Many such titles of Europeans will be found in North Indian N. & Q., i. 35, 143, 179; iv. 17.]\n In Anglo-Indian colloquial parlance the word denotes a haughty or pompous personage, exercising his brief authority with a strong sense of his own importance; a don rather than a swaggerer. Thackeray, who derived from his Indian birth and connections a humorous felicity in the use of Anglo-Indian expressions, has not omitted this serviceable word. In that brilliant burlesque, the Memoirs of Major Gahagan, we have the Mahratta traitor Bobachee Bahauder. It is said also that Mr Canning's malicious wit bestowed on Sir John Malcolm, who was not less great as a talker than as a soldier and statesman, the title, not included in the Great Mogul's repertory, of Bahauder Jaw.*\n Bah\u0101dur is one of the terms which the hosts of Chingiz Khan brought with them from the Mongol Steppes. In the Mongol genealogies we find Yesugai Bah\u0101dur, the father of Chingiz, and many more. Subutai Bah\u0101dur, one of the great soldiers of the Mongol host, twice led it to the conquest of Southern Russia, twice to that of Northern China. In Sanang Setzen's poetical annals of the Mongols, as rendered by I. J. Schmidt, the word is written Baghatur, whence in Russian Bogatir still survives as a memento probably of the Tartar domination, meaning 'a hero or champion.' It occurs often in the old Russian epic ballads in this sense; and is also applied to Samson of the Bible. It occurs in a Russian chronicler as early as 1240, but in application to Mongol leaders. In Polish it is found as Bohatyr, and in Hungarian as B\u00e1tor, -- this last being in fact the popular Mongol pronunciation of Baghatur. In Turki also this elision of the guttural extends to the spelling, and the word becomes B\u0101tur, as we find it in the Dicts. of Vamb\u00e9ry and Pavet de Courteille. In Manchu also the word takes the form of Baturu, expressed in Chinese characters as Pa-tu-lu;\u2020 the Kirghiz has it as Batyr; the Altai-Tataric as Paattyr, and the other dialects even as Magathyr. But the singular history of the word is not yet entirely told. Benfey has suggested that the word originated in Skt. bhaga-dhara ('happiness-possessing').\u2021 But the late lamented Prof. A. Schiefner, who favoured us with a note on the subject, was strongly of opinion that the word was rather a corruption \"through dissimulation of the consonant, \" of the Zend bagha-puthra 'Son of God,' and thus but another form of the famous term Faghf\u016br, by which the old Persians rendered the Chinese Tien-tsz ('Son of Heaven'), applying it to the Emperor of China.\n At Lord Wellesley's table, Major Malcolm mentioned as a notable fact that he and three of his brothers had once met together in India. \"Impossible, Malcolm, quite impossible!\" said the Governor-General. Malcolm persisted. \"No, no,\" said Lord Wellesley, \"if four Malcolms had met, we should have heard the noise all over India!\"\n See Chinese Recorder, 1876, vii. 324, and Kovalefski's Mongol Dict.

Hence also 'Kampan\u00ed Bahadur,' the name by which the E. I. Company is still known in India. The modern 'Khan Bah\u00e1dur' is, in Bengal, by permission assumed by Muhammedan Deputy Magistrates, whilst Hindu Deputy Magistrates assume 'R\u00e1i Bah\u00e1dur'; it stands, of course, for 'Kh\u00e1n-i-Bah\u00e1dur,' 'the courageous Kh\u00e1n.' The compound, however, is a modern abnormal one; for 'Kh\u00e1n' was conferred by the Dihli Emperors, and so also 'Bah\u00e1dur' and 'Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n,' but not 'Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur.'\" -- Prof. Blochmann, in Ind.

Not an Anglo-Indian word, but sometimes regarded as of Oriental origin; a thing more than doubtful. The etymology alluded to by Mr. Schuyler and by the lamented William Gill in the quotations below, is not new, though we do not know who first suggested it. Neither do we know whether the word balagani, which Erman (Tr. in Siberia, E. T. i. 115) tells us is the name given to the wooden booths at the Nijnei Fair, be the same P. word or no. Wedgwood, Littr\u00e9, [and the N.E.D.] connect balcony with the word which appears in English as balk, and with the Italian balco, 'a scaffolding' and the like, also used for 'a box' at the play. Balco, as well as palco, is a form occurring in early Italian. Thus Franc. da Buti, commenting on Dante (1385-87), says: \"Balco \u00e8 luogo alto doue si monta e scende.\" Hence naturally would be formed balcone, which we have in Giov. Villani, in Boccaccio and in Petrarch.

It often takes the further form b\u0101l-b\u016br, another factitious hybrid, shaped by P. b\u016br\u012bdan, 'to cut,' quasi 'hair-cutter.' But though now obsolete, there was also (see both Meninski and Vullers s.v.) a Persian word b\u0103rb\u0103r, for a barber or surgeon, from which came this Turkish term \"Le Berber-bachi, qui fait la barbe au Pacha,\" which we find (c. 1674) in the Appendix to the journal of Antoine Galland, pubd. at Paris, 1881 (ii. 190). It looks as if this must have been an early loan from Europe.\n", "bamboo": "s. Applied to many gigantic grasses, of which Bambusa arundinacea and B. vulgaris are the most commonly cultivated; but there are many other species of the same and allied genera in use; natives of tropical Asia, Africa, and America. This word, one of the commonest in Anglo-Indian daily use, and thoroughly naturalised in English, is of exceedingly obscure origin. According to Wilson it is Canarese b\u0103nb\u016d [or as the Madras Admin. Man. (Gloss. s.v.) writes it, bombu, which is said to be \"onomatopaeic from the crackling and explosions when they burn\"]. Marsden inserts it in his dictionary as good Malay. Crawfurd says it is certainly used on the west coast of Sumatra, as a native word, but that it is elsewhere unknown to the Malay languages. The usual Malay word is buluh. He thinks it more likely to have found its way into English from Sumatra than from Canara. But there is evidence enough of its familiarity among the Portuguese before the end of the 16th century to indicate the probability that we adopted the word, like so many others, through them. We believe that the correct Canarese word is ba\u1e47wu. In the 16th century the form in the Concan appears to have been mambu, or at least it was so represented by the Portuguese. Rumphius seems to suggest a quaint onomatopoeia: \"vehementissimos edunt ictus et sonitus, quum incendio comburuntur, quando notum ejus nomen Bambu, Bambu, facile exauditur.\"- (Herb. Amb. iv. 17.) [Mr. Skeat writes: \"Although buluh is the standard Malay, and bambu apparently introduced, I think bambu is the form used in the low Javanese vernacular, which is quite a different language from high Javanese. Even in low Javanese, however, it may be a borrowed word. It looks curiously like a trade corruption of the common Malay word samambu, which means the well-known 'Malacca cane,' both the bamboo and the Malacca cane being articles of export. Klinkert says that the samambu is a kind of rattan, which was used as a walkingstick, and which was called the Malacca cane by the English. This Malacca cane and the rattan 'bamboo cane' referred to by Sir H. Yule must surely be identical. The fuller Malay name is actually rotan samambu, which is given as the equivalent of Calamus Scipionum, Lour. by Mr. Ridley in his Plant List (J.R.A.S., July 1897).]\n The term applied to \u1e6d\u0101b\u0101sh\u012br (Tabasheer), a siliceous concretion in the bamboo, in our first quotation seems to show that bambu or mambu was one of the words which the Portuguese inherited from an earlier use by Persian or Arab traders. But we have not been successful in finding other proof of this. With reference to sakkarmambu Ritter says: \"That this drug (Tabashir), as a product of the bamboocane, is to this day known in India by the name of Sacar Mambu is a thing which no one needs to be told\" (ix. 334). But in fact the name seems now entirely unknown.\n It is possible that the Canarese word is a vernacular corruption, or development, of the Skt. va\u1e47\u015ba [or vambha], from the former of which comes the H. b\u0101\u1e47s. Bamboo does not occur, so far as we can find, in any of the earlier 16th-century books, which employ canna or the like.\n In England the term bamboo-cane is habitually applied to a kind of walking-stick, which is formed not from any bamboo but from a species of rattan. It may be noted that some 30 to 35 years ago there existed along the high road between Putney Station and West Hill a garden fence of bamboos of considerable extent; it often attracted the attention of one of the present writers.\n 1563. -- \"The people from whom it (tabashir) is got call it sacar-mambum . . . . because the canes of that plant are called by the Indians mambu.\" -- Garcia, f. 194.\n 1578. -- \"Some of these (canes), especially in Malabar, are found so large that the people make use of them as boats (embarcaciones) not opening them out, but cutting one of the canes right across and using the natural knots to stop the ends, and so a couple of naked blacks go upon it . . . each of them at his own end of the mambu [in orig. ma\u0303bu] (so they call it), being provided with two paddles, one in each hand . . . . and so upon a cane of this kind the folk pass across, and sitting with their legs clinging naked.\" -- C. Acosta, Tractado, 296.\n Again:\n \". . . and many people on that river (of Cranganor) make use of these canes in place of boats, to be safe from the numerous Crocodiles or Caymoins (as they call them) which are in the river (which are in fact great and ferocious lizards)\" [lagartos].- Ibid. 297.\n These passages are curious as explaining, if they hardly justify, Ctesias, in what we have regarded as one of his greatest bounces, viz. his story of Indian canes big enough to be used as boats.\n 1586. -- \"All the houses are made of canes, which they call Bambos, and bee covered with Strawe.\" -- Fitch, in Hakl. ii. 391.\n 1598. -- \". . . a thicke reede as big as a man's legge, which is called Bambus.\"- Linschoten, 56; [Hak.

Scaffolding and ladders, landing-jetties, fishing apparatus, irrigationwheels and scoops, oars, masts and yards, spears and arrows, hats and helmets, bow, bow-string and quiver, oil-cans, water-stoups and cooking-pots, pipe-sticks, conduits, clothes-boxes, pan - boxes, dinner - trays, pickles, preserves, and melodious musical instruments, torches, footballs, cordage, bellows, mats, paper, these are but a few of the articles that are made from the bamboo.\" -- Yule, Mission to Ava, p. 153. To these may be added, from a cursory inspection of a collection in one of the museums at Kew, combs, mugs, sun-blinds, cages, grotesque carvings, brushes, fans, shirts, sails, teapots, pipes and harps.\n Bamboos are sometimes popularly distinguished (after a native idiom) as male and female; the latter embracing all the common species with hollow stems, the former title being applied to a certain kind (in fact, a sp. of a distinct genus, Dendrocalamus strictus), which has a solid or nearly solid core, and is much used for bludgeons (see LATTEE) and spearshafts. It is remarkable that this popular distinction by sex was known to Ctesias (c. B.C. 400) who says that the Indian reeds were divided into male and female, the male having no E)NTERW/NHN.\n One of the present writers has seen (and partaken of) rice cooked in a joint of bamboo, among the Khyens, a hillpeople of Arakan. And Mr Markham mentions the same practice as prevalent among the Chunchos and savage aborigines on the eastern slopes of the Andes (J. R. Geog. Soc. xxv. 155). An endeavour was made in Pegu in 1855 to procure the largest obtainable bamboo. It was a little over 10 inches in diameter. But Clusius states that he had seen two great specimens in the University at Leyden, 30 feet long and from 14 to 16 inches in diameter. And E. Haeckel, in his Visit to Ceylon (1882), speaks of bamboo-stems at Peridenia, \"each from a foot to two feet thick.\" We can obtain no corroboration of anything approaching 2 feet. -- [See Gray's note on Pyrard, Hak.

This word is not used in India, though one hears it in the Straits Settlements. The word itself is said by De Orta to have come from Guinea; so also Pigafetta (see below). The matter will be more conveniently treated under PLANTAIN. Prof. Robertson Smith points out that the coincidence of this name with the Ar. ban\u0101n, 'fingers or toes,' and ban\u0101na, 'a single finger or toe,' can hardly be accidental. The fruit, as we learn from Mukaddas\u012b, grew in Palestine before the Crusades; and that it is known in literature only as mauz would not prove that the fruit was not somewhere popularly known as 'fingers.' It is possible that the Arabs, through whom probably the fruit found its way to W. Africa, may have transmitted with it a name like this; though historical evidence is still to seek. [Mr. Skeat writes: \"It is curious that in Norwegian and Danish (and I believe in Swedish), the exact Malay word pisang, which is unknown in England, is used. Prof. Skeat thinks this may be because we had adopted the word banana before the word pisang was brought to Europe at all.\"]\n 1563. -- \"The Arab calls these musa or amusa; there are chapters on the subject in Avicenna and Serapion, and they call them by this name, as does Rasis also.

The name of the old Portuguese settlement in Bengal about a mile above Hoogly, where there still exists a monastery, said to be the oldest church in Bengal (see Imp. Gazeteer). The name is a Port. corruption of bandar, 'the wharf'; and in this shape the word was applied among the Portuguese to a variety of places. Thus in Correa, under 1541-42, we find mention of a port in the Red Sea, near the mouth, called Bandel dos Malemos ('of the Pilots'). Chittagong is called Bandel de Chatiga\u0303o (e.g. in Bocarro, p. 444), corresponding to Bandar Ch\u0101tg\u0101m in the Autobiog. of Jah\u0101ng\u012br (Elliot, vi. 326). [In the Diary of Sir T.

A warehouse. b . The office of a Harbour Master or other Port Authority. In the former sense the word is still used in S. India; in Bengal the latter is the only sense recognised, at least among Anglo-Indians; in Northern India the word is not in use. As the Calcutta office stands on the banks of the Hoogly, the name is, we believe, often accepted as having some indefinite reference to this position. And in a late work we find a positive and plausible, but entirely unfounded, explanation of this kind, which we quote below. In Java the word has a specific application to the open hall of audience, supported by wooden pillars without walls, which forms part of every princely residence. The word is used in Sea Hindustani, in the forms bans\u0101r, and bangs\u0101l for a 'store-room' (Roebuck).\n Bankshall is in fact one of the oldest of the words taken up by foreign traders in India. And its use not only by Correa (c. 1561) but by King John (1524), with the regularly-formed Portuguese plural of words in -al, shows how early it was adopted by the Portuguese. Indeed, Correa does not even explain it, as is his usual practice with Indian terms.\n More than one serious etymology has been suggested: -- (1). Crawfurd takes it to be the Malay word bangsal, defined by him in his Malay Dict. thus: \"(J.) A shed; a storehouse; a workshop; a porch; a covered passage\" (see J. Ind. Archip. iv. 182). [Mr Skeat adds that it also means in Malay 'half-husked paddy,' and 'fallen timber, of which the outer layer has rotted and only the core remains.'] But it is probable that the Malay word, though marked by Crawfurd (\"J.\") as Javanese in origin, is a corruption of one of the two following:\n (2) Beng. ba\u1e47ka\u015b\u0101la, from Skt. ba\u1e47ik or va\u1e47ik, 'trade,' and \u015b\u0101la, 'a hall.' This is Wilson's etymology.\n (3). Skt. bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\u015b\u0101la, Canar. bha\u1e47- da\u015b\u0101le, Malay\u0101l. p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0di\u015b\u0101la, Tam. pa\u1e47\u1e0da\u015b\u0101lai or pa\u1e47\u1e0daka\u015b\u0101lai, 'a storehouse or magazine.'\n It is difficult to decide which of the two last is the original word; the prevalence of the second in S. India is an argument in its favour; and the substitution of g for \u1e0d would be in accordance with a phonetic practice of not uncommon occurrence.\n a.-\n c. 1345. -- \"For the bandar there is in every island (of the Maldives) a wooden building, which they call bajan\u1e63\u0101r [evidently for banjas\u0101r, i.e. Arabic spelling for banga\u1e63\u0101r] where the Governor . . . collects all the goods, and there sells or barters them.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iv. 120.\n [1520. -- \"Collected in his bamgasal\" (in the Maldives). -- Doc. da Torre do Tombo, p. 452.]\n 1524. -- A grant from K.

A Hindu trader, and especially of the Province of Guzerat; many of which class have for ages been settled in Arabian ports and known by this name; but the term is often applied by early travellers in Western India to persons of the Hindu religion generally. b. In Calcutta also it is (or perhaps rather was) specifically applied to the native brokers attached to houses of business, or to persons in the employment of a private gentleman doing analogous duties (now usually called sircar).\n The word was adopted from V\u0101\u1e47iya, a man of the trading caste (in Gujar\u0101ti v\u0101\u1e47iyo), and that comes from Skt. va\u1e47ij, 'a merchant.' The terminal nasal may be a Portuguese addition (as in palanquin, mandarin, Bassein), or it may be taken from the plural form v\u0101\u1e47iy\u0101n. It is probable, however, that the Portuguese found the word already in use by the Arab traders. Sidi 'Ali, the Turkish Admiral, uses it in precisely the same form, applying it to the Hindus generally; and in the poem of Sassui and Panhu, the Sindian Romeo and Juliet, as given by Burton in his Sindh (p. 101), we have the form W\u0101niy\u0101n.

Two different words are thus expressed in Anglo-Indian colloquial, and in a manner confounded. \n a. H. bhata or bh\u0101t\u0101: an extra allowance made to officers, soldiers, or other public servants, when in the field, or on other special grounds; also subsistence money to witnesses, prisoners, and the like. Military Batta, originally an occasional allowance, as defined, grew to be a constant addition to the pay of officers in India, and constituted the chief part of the excess of Indian over English military emoluments. The question of the right to batta on several occasions created great agitation among the officers of the Indian army, and the measure of economy carried out by Lord William Bentinck when Governor-General (G. O. of the Gov. -- Gen. in Council, 29th November 1828) in the reduction of full batta to half batta, in the allowances received by all regimental officers serving at stations within a certain distance of the Presidency in Bengal (viz. Barrackpore, Dumdum, Berhampore, and Dinapore) caused an enduring bitterness against that upright ruler.\n It is difficult to arrive at the origin of this word. There are, however several Hindi words in rural use, such as bh\u0101t, bhant\u0101, 'advances made to ploughmen without interest,' and bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, bha\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101, 'ploughmen's wages in kind,' with which it is possibly connected. It has also been suggested, without much probability, that it may be allied to bahut, 'much, excess,' an idea entering into the meaning of both a and b. It is just possible that the familiar military use of the term in India may have been influenced by the existence of the European military term ba\u0302t or ba\u0302t-money. The latter is from ba\u0302t, 'a pack-saddle,' [Late Lat. bastum], and implies an allowance for carrying baggage in the field. It will be seen that one writer below seems to confound the two words.\n b. H. ba\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101 and b\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101: agio, or difference in exchange, discount on coins not current, or of short weight. We may notice that Sir H. Elliot does not recognize an absolute separation between the two senses of Batta. His definition runs thus: \"Difference of exchange; anything extra; an extra allowance; discount on uncurrent, or short-weight coins; usually called Batta. The word has been supposed to be a corruption of Bharta, increase, but it is a pure Hindi vocable, and is more usually applied to discount than to premium.\" -- (Supp. Gloss. ii. 41.) [Platts, on the other hand, distinguishes the two words -- Ba\u1e6d\u1e6da, Skt. v\u1e5bitta, 'turned,' or varta, 'livelihood' -- \"Exchange, discount, difference of exchange, deduction, &c.,\" and Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, Skt. bhakta 'allotted,' -- \"advances to ploughmen without interest; ploughman's wages in kind.\"] It will be seen that we have early Portuguese instances of the word apparently in both senses.\n The most probable explanation is that the word (and I may add, the thing) originated in the Portuguese practice, and in the use of the Canarese word bhatta, Mahr, bh\u0101t, 'rice' in 'the husk,' called by the Portuguese bate and bata, for a maintenance allowance.\n The word batty, for what is more generally called paddy, is or was commonly used by the English also in S. and W. India (see Linschoten, Lucena and Fryer quoted s.v. Paddy, and Wilson's Glossary, s.v. Bhatta).\n The practice of giving a special allowance for mantimento began from a very early date in the Indian history of the Portuguese, and it evidently became a recognised augmentation of pay, corresponding closely to our batta, whilst the quotation from Botelho below shows also that bata and mantimento were used, more or less interchangeably, for this allowance. The correspondence with our Anglo-Indian batta went very far, and a case singularly parallel to the discontent raised in the Indian army by the reduction of full-batta to half-batta is spoken of by Correa (iv. 256). The mantimento had been paid all the year round, but the Governor, Martin Afonso de Sousa, in 1542, \"desiring,\" says the historian, \"a way to curry favour for himself, whilst going against the people and sending his soul to hell,\" ordered that in future the mantimento should be paid only during the 6 months of Winter (i.e. of the rainy season), when the force was on shore, and not for the other 6 months when they were on board the cruisers, and received rations. This created great bitterness, perfectly analogous in depth and in expression to that entertained with regard to Lord W. Bentinck and Sir John Malcolm, in 1829. Correa's utterance, just quoted, illustrates this, and a little lower down he adds: \"And thus he took away from the troops the half of their mantimento (half their batta, in fact), and whether he did well or ill in that, he'll find in the next world.\" -- (See also ibid. p. 430).\n The following quotations illustrate the Portuguese practice from an early date:\n 1502. -- \"The Captain-major . . . between officers and men-at-arms, left 60 men (at Cochin), to whom the factor was to give their pay, and every month a cruz\u00e1do of mantimento, and to the officers when on service 2 cruz\u00e1dos. . . .\" -- Corre\u00e4, i. 328.\n 1507. -- (In establishing the settlement at Mozambique) \"And the Captains took counsel among themselves, and from the money in the chest, paid the force each a cruz\u00e1do a month for mantimento, with which the men greatly refreshed themselves. . . .\" -- Ibid. 786.\n 1511. -- \"All the people who served in Malaca, whether by sea or by land, were paid their pay for six months in advance, and also received monthly two cruzados of mantimento, cash in hand\" (i.e. they had double batta). -- Ibid. ii. 267.\n a.\n 1548. -- \"And for 2 ffarazes (see FARASH) 2 pardaos a month for the two and 4 tangas for bata.\" . . . -- S. Botelho, Tombo, 233. The editor thinks this is for bate, i.e. paddy. But even if so it is used exactly like batta or maintenance money. A following entry has: \"To the constable 38,920 reis a year, in which is comprised maintenance (mantimento).\"\n 1554. -- An example of batee for rice will be found s. v. MOORAH.\n The following quotation shows battee (or batty) used at Madras in a way that also indicates the original identity of batty, 'rice,' and batta, 'extra allowance': -- \n 1680. -- \"The Peons and Tarryars (see TALIAR) sent in quest of two soldiers who had deserted from the garrison returned with answer that they could not light of them, whereupon the Peons were turned out of service, but upon Verona's intercession were taken in again, and fined each one month's pay, and to repay the money paid them for Battee. . . .\" -- Ft.

What the Hebrew bdolah of the R. Phison was, which was rendered bdellium since the time of Josephus, remains very doubtful. Lassen has suggested musk as possible.

An acute disease, obscure in its nature and pathology, generally but not always presenting dropsical symptoms, as well as paralytic weakness and numbness of the lower extremities, with oppressed breathing. In cases where debility, oppression, anxiety and dyspn\u0153a are extremely severe, the patient sometimes dies in 6 to 30 hours. Though recent reports seem to refer to this disease as almost confined to natives, it is on record that in 1795, in Trincomalee, 200 Europeans died of it.\n The word has been alleged to be Singhalese beri [the Mad. Admin. Man. Gloss. s. v. gives baribari], 'debility.' This kind of reduplication is really a common Singhalese practice. It is also sometimes alleged to be a W. Indian Negro term; and other worthless guesses have been made at its origin. The Singhalese origin is on the whole most probable [and is accepted by the N.E.D.]. In the quotations from Bontius and Bluteau, the disease described seems to be that formerly known as Barbiers. Some authorities have considered these diseases as quite distinct, but Sir Joseph Fayrer, who has paid attention to beriberi and written upon it (see The Practitioner, January 1877), regards Barbiers as \"the dry form of beri-beri,\" and Dr. Lodewijks, quoted below, says briefly that \"the Barbiers of some French writers is incontestably the same disease.\" (On this it is necessary to remark that the use of the term Barbiers is by no means confined to French writers, as a glance at the quotations under that word will show). The disease prevails endemically in Ceylon, and in Peninsular India in the coast-tracts, and up to 40 or 60 m. inland; also in Burma and the Malay region, including all the islands, at least so far as New Guinea, and also Japan, where it is known as kakk\u00e9: [see Chamberlain, Things Japanese, 3rd ed. p. 238 seqq.]. It is very prevalent in certain Madras Jails. The name has become somewhat old-fashioned, but it has recurred of late years, especially in hospital reports from Madras and Burma. It is frequently epidemic, and some of the Dutch physicians regard it as infectious. See a pamphlet, Beri-Beri door J. A. Lodewijks, ondofficier van Gezondheit bij het Ned. Indische Leger, Harderwijk, 1882. In this pamphlet it is stated that in 1879 the total number of beri-beri patients in the military hospitals of Netherlands-India, amounted to 9873, and the deaths among these to 1682. In the great military hospitals at Achin there died of beri-beri between 1st November 1879, and 1st April 1880, 574 persons, of whom the great majority were dwangarbeiders, i.e. 'forced labourers.' These statistics show the extraordinary prevalence and fatality of the disease in the Archipelago. Dutch literature on the subject is considerable. \n Sir George Birdwood tells us that during the Persian Expedition of 1857 he witnessed beri-beri of extraordinary virulence, especially among the East African stokers on board the steamers. The sufferers became dropsically distended to a vast extent, and died in a few hours.\n In the second quotation scurvy is evidently meant. This seems much allied by causes to beriberi though different in character.\n [1568. -- \"Our people sickened of a disease called berbere, the belly and legs swell, and in a few days they die, as there died many, ten or twelve a day.\" -- Couto, viii. ch. 25.]\n c. 1610. -- \"Ce ne fut pas tout, car i'eus encor ceste fascheuse maladie de louende que les Portugais appellent autrement berber et les Hollandais scurbut.\" -- Mocquet, 221.\n 1613. -- \"And under the orders of the said General Andr\u00e9 Furtado de Mendo\u00e7a, the discoverer departed to the court of Goa, being ill with the malady of the berebere, in order to get himself treated.\" -- Godinho de Eredia, f. 58.\n 1631. -- \". . .

The quotations of Littr\u00e9 from Ambrose Par\u00e9 show that the word was used generically for 'an antidote,' and in this sense it is used habitually by Avicenna. No doubt the term came to us, with so many others, from Arab medical writers, so much studied in the Middle Ages, and this accounts for the b, as Arabic has no p, and writes b\u0101zahr. But its usual application was, and is, limited to certain hard concretions found in the bodies of animals, to which antidotal virtues were ascribed, and especially to one obtained from the stomach of a wild goat in the Persian province of Lar. Of this animal and the bezoar an account is given in Kaempfer's Amoenitates Exoticae, pp. 398 seqq. The Bezoar was sometimes called Snake-Stone, and erroneously supposed to be found in the head of a snake. It may have been called so really because, as Ibn Baithar states, such a stone was laid upon the bite of a venomous creature (and was believed) to extract the poison. Moodeen Sheriff, in his Suppt. to the Indian Pharmacop\u0153ia, says there are various bezoars in use (in native mat. med.), distinguished according to the animal producing them, as a goat-, camel-, fish-, and snake-bezoar; the last quite distinct from Snake-Stone (q.v.).\n [A false Bezoar stone gave occasion for the establishment of one of the great distinctions in our Common Law, viz. between actions founded upon contract, and those founded upon wrongs: Chandelor v. Lopus was decided in 1604 (reported in 2. Croke, and in Smith's Leading Cases). The head-note runs \"The defendant sold to the plaintiff a stone, which he affirmed to be a Bezoar stone, but which proved not to be so. No action lies against him, unless he either knew that it was not a Bezoar stone, or warranted it to be a Bezoar stone\" (quoted by Gray, Pyrard de Laval, Hak. Soc. ii. 484).]\n 1516. -- Barbosa writes pajar.\n [1528. -- \"Near this city (Lara) in a small mountain are bred some animals of the size of a buck, in whose stomach grows a stone they call bazar.\" -- Tenreiro, ch. iii. p. 14.]\n [1554. -- Castanheda (I. ch. 46) calls the animal whence bezoar comes bagoldaf, which he considers an Indian word.]\n c. 1580. -- \". . . adeo ut ex solis Bezahar nonnulla vasa conflata viderim, maxime apud eos qui a venenis sibi cavere student.\"- Prosper Alpinus, Pt. i. p. 56.\n 1599. -- \"Body o' me, a shrewd mischance.

Both the city and the kingdom were commonly called by the early Portuguese Narsinga (q.v.), from Narasimha (c. 1490-1508), who was king at the time of their first arrival.

But K\u0101l\u0101 \u0101dm\u012b 'black man,' is often used by them in speaking to Europeans of other natives. A case in point is perhaps worth recording. A statue of Lord William Bentinck, on foot, and in bronze, stands in front of the Calcutta Town Hall. Many years ago a native officer, returning from duty at Calcutta to Barrackpore, where his regiment was, reported himself to his adjutant (from whom we had the story in later days). 'Anything new, S\u016bbad\u0101r, S\u0101hib?' said the Adjutant. 'Yes,' said the S\u016bbad\u0101r, 'there is a figure of the former Lord Sahib arrived.' 'And what do you think of it?'

('It is now just like a native -- 'a black man'); when the whitewash is applied it will be excellent.'\n In some few phrases the term has become crystallised and semi-official. Thus the native dressers in a hospital were, and possibly still are, called Black Doctors.\n 1787. -- \"The Surgeon's assistant and Black Doctor take their station 100 paces in the rear, or in any place of security to which the Doolies may readily carry the wounded.\" -- Regulations for the H.

This Act was drafted by T. B. Macaulay, then Legislative Member of the Governor-General's Council, and brought great abuse on his head. Recent agitation caused by the \"Ilbert Bill,\" proposing to make Europeans subject to native magistrates in regard to police and criminal charges, has been, by advocates of the latter measure, put on all fours with the agitation of 1836. But there is much that discriminates the two cases.\n 1876. -- \"The motive of the scurrility with which Macaulay was assailed by a handful of sorry scribblers was his advocacy of the Act, familiarly known as the Black Act, which withdrew from British subjects resident in the provinces their so called privilege of bringing civil appeals before the Supreme Court at Calcutta.\" -- Trevelyan's Life of Macaulay, 2nd ed., i. 398.\n [BLACK BEER, s.

C. 1430, we find the islands of Mahim and Mumba-Devi, which united form the existing island of Bombay, held, along with Salsette, by a Hindu R\u0101\u012b, who was tributary to the Mohammedan King of Guzerat.

The latter author, mentioning the excellence of the areca produced there, speaks of himself having had a grant of the island from the King of Portugal (see below). It is customarily called Bombaim on the earliest English Rupee coinage. (See under RUPEE.)

We will quote two noble examples of public virtue:\n (1) In July 1811, a squadron under Commodore John Hayes took two large junks issuing from Batavia, then under blockade. These were lawful prize, laden with Dutch property, valued at \u00a3600,000. But Hayes knew that such a capture would create great difficulties and embarrassments in the English trade at Canton, and he directed the release of this splendid prize.\n (2) 30th June 1815, Lieut. Boyce in the brig 'Nautilus' (180 tons, carrying ten 18-pr. carronades, and four 9-prs.) encountered the U.S. sloop-of-war 'Peacock' (539 tons, carrying twenty 32-pr. carronades, and two long 18-prs.). After he had informed the American of the ratification of peace, Boyce was peremptorily ordered to haul down his colours, which he answered by a flat refusal. The 'Peacock' opened fire, and a short but brisk action followed, in which Boyce and his first lieutenant were shot down. The gallant Boyce had a special pension from the Company (\u00a3435 in all) and lived to his 93rd year to enjoy it.\n We take the facts from the History of this Navy by one of its officers, Lieut. C. R. Low (i. 294), but he erroneously states the pension to have been granted by the U.S. Govt.\n 1780. -- \"The Hon. Company's schooner, Carinjar, with Lieut.

A term long applied by Europeans in China to the Buddhist clergy, but originating with early visitors to Japan. Its origin is however not quite clear. The Chinese F\u00e1n-s\u0113ng, 'a religious person' is in Japanese bonzi or bonz\u00f4; but K\u00f6ppen prefers f\u0103-sze, 'Teacher of the Law,' pron. in Japanese bo-zi (Die Rel. des Buddha, i. 321, and also Schott's Zur Litt. des Chin.

On the other hand, Bandhya (for Skt. vandya, 'to whom worship or reverence is due, very reverend') seems to be applied in Nepal to the Buddhist clergy, and Hodgson considers the Japanese bonze (bonz\u00f4?) traceable to this. (Essays, 1874, p. 63.) The same word, as bandhe or bande, is in Tibetan similarly applied. -- (See Jaeschke's Dict., p. 365.)

H. and Guz. bohr\u0101 and bohor\u0101, which H. H.

This is confirmed by the quotation from Nurullah below, but it is not quite certain. Dr. John Wilson (see below) gives an Arabic derivation which we have been unable to verify. [There can be no reasonable doubt that this is incorrect.]\n There are two classes of Bohr\u0101s belonging to different Mohammedan sects, and different in habit of life.\n 1. The Sh\u012b'a Bohr\u0101s, who are essentially townspeople, and especially congregate in Surat, Burhanpur, Ujjain, &c. They are those best known far and wide by the name, and are usually devoted to trading and money-lending. Their original seat was in Guzerat, and they are most numerous there, and in the Bombay territory generally, but are also to be found in various parts of Central India and the N.-W. Provinces, [where they are all Hindus]. The word in Bombay is often used as synonymous with pedlar or boxwallah. They are generally well-to-do people, keeping very cleanly and comfortable houses. [See an account of them in Forbes, Or. Mem. i. 470 seqq. 2nd ed.] These Bohras appear to form one of the numerous Sh\u012b'a sects, akin in character to, and apparently of the same origin as, the Ism\u0101\u012bl\u012byah (or Assassins of the Middle Ages), and claim as their original head and doctor in India one Ya'k\u016bb, who emigrated from Egypt, and landed in Cambay A.D. 1137. But the chief seat of the doctrine is alleged to have been in Yemen, till that country was conquered by the Turks in 1538. A large exodus of the sect to India then took place. Like the Ism\u0101\u012bl\u012bs they attach a divine character to their Mullah or chief Pontiff, who now resides at Surat. They are guided by him in all things, and they pay him a percentage on their profits. But there are several sectarian subdivisions: D\u0101\u016bdi Bohr\u0101s, Sulaim\u0101ni Bohr\u0101s, &c. [See Forbes, R\u0101s M\u0101l\u0101, ed. 1878, p. 264 seqq.]\n 2. The Sunni Bohr\u0101s. These are very numerous in the Northern Concan and Guzerat. They are essentially peasants, sturdy, thrifty, and excellent cultivators, retaining much of Hindu habit; and are, though they have dropped caste distinctions, very exclusive and \"denominational\" (as the Bombay Gazetteer expresses it). Exceptionally, at Pattan, in Baroda State, there is a rich and thriving community of trading Bohr\u0101s of the Sunni section; they have no intercourse with their Sh\u012b'a namesakes.\n The history of the Bohr\u0101s is still very obscure; nor does it seem ascertained whether the two sections were originally one. Some things indicate that the Sh\u012b'a Bohr\u0101s may be, in accordance with their tradition, in some considerable part of foreign descent, and that the Sunni Bohr\u0101s, who are unquestionably of Hindu descent, may have been native converts of the foreign immigrants, afterwards forcibly brought over to Sunnism by the Guzerat Sultans. But all this must be said with much reserve. The history is worthy of investigation.\n The quotation from Ibn Batuta, which refers to Gandari on the Baroda river, south of Cambay, alludes most probably to the Bohr\u0101s, and may perhaps, though not necessarily, indicate an origin for the name different from either of those suggested.\n c. 1343. -- \"When we arrived at Kandah\u0101r . . . we received a visit from the principal Musulmans dwelling at his (the pagan King's) Capital, such as the Children of Khojah Bohrah, among whom was the N\u0101khoda Ibrah\u012bm, who had 6 vessels belonging to him.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iv. 58.\n c. 1620. -- Nurullah of Shuster, quoted by Colebrooke, speaks of this class as having been converted to Islam 300 years before. He says also: \"Most of them subsist by commerce and mechanical trades; as is indicated by the name Bohrah, which signifies 'merchant' in the dialect of Gujerat.\" -- In As. Res., vii. 338.\n 1673. -- \". . .

It is a quasipyramidal structure occupying the summit of a hill, which apparently forms the core of the building. It is quadrangular in plan, the sides, however, broken by successive projections; each side of the basement, 406 feet. Including the basement, it rises in six successive terraces, four of them forming corridors, the sides of which are panelled with bas-reliefs, which Mr. Fergusson calculated would, if extended in a single line, cover three miles of ground. These represent scenes in the life of Sakya Muni, scenes from the J\u0101takas, or pre-existences of Sakya, and other series of Buddhistic groups. Above the corridors the structure be comes circular, rising in three shallower stages, bordered with small dagobas (72 in number), and a large dagoba crowns the whole. The 72 dagobas are hollow, built in a kind of stone lattice, and each contains, or has contained, within, a stone Buddha in the usual attitude. In niches of the corridors also are numerous Buddhas larger than life, and about 400 in number. Mr. Fergusson concludes from various data that this wonderful structure must date from A.D. 650 to 800.\n This monument is not mentioned in Valentijn's great History of the Dutch Indies (1726), nor does its name ever seem to have reached Europe till Sir Stamford Raffles, the British Lieut.-Governor of Java, visited the district in January 1814. The structure was then covered with soil and vegetation, even with trees of considerable size. Raffles caused it to be cleared, and drawings and measurements to be made. His History of Java, and Crawford's Hist. of the Indian Archipelago, made it known to the world. The Dutch Government, in 1874, published a great collection of illustrative plates, with a descriptive text.\n The meaning of the name by which this monument is known in the neighbourhood has been much debated. Raffles writes it B\u00f3ro B\u00f3do [Hist. of Java, 2nd ed., ii. 30 seqq.]. [Crawfurd, Descr. Dict. (s.v.), says: \"Boro is, in Javanese, the name of a kind of fishtrap, and budor may possibly be a corruption of the Sanscrit buda, 'old.'\"] The most probable interpretation, and accepted by Friedrich and other scholars of weight, is that of 'Myriad Buddhas.' This would be in some analogy to another famous Buddhist monument in a neighbouring district, at Bramb\u00e1nan, which is called Chandi Sewu, or the \"Thousand Temples,\" though the number has been really 238.\n", "bosh": "s. and interj.

Brown (Zillah Dict. s.v.) says it is the Telegu b\u0101vidi; b\u0101v\u012b and b\u0101vidi, = 'well.' This is doubtless the same word, but in all its forms it is probably connected with Skt. vavra, 'a hole, a well,' or with v\u0101pi, 'an oblong reservoir, a pool or lake.' There is also in Singhalese v\u0153va, 'a lake or pond,' and in inscriptions vaviya. There is again Maldivian weu, 'a well,' which comes near the Guzerati forms mentioned below. A great and deep rectangular well (or tank dug down to the springs), furnished with a descent to the water by means of long flights of steps, and generally with landings and loggie where travellers may rest in the shade. This kind of structure, almost peculiar to Western and Central India, though occasionally met with in Northern India also, is a favourite object of private native munificence, and though chiefly beneath the level of the ground, is often made the subject of most effective architecture. Some of the finest specimens are in Guzerat, where other forms of the word appear to be w\u0101o and w\u0101\u012bn. One of the most splendid of these structures is that at As\u0101rwa in the suburbs of Ahmedabad, known as the Well of Dh\u0101\u012b (or 'the Nurse') Har\u012br, built in 1485 by a lady of the household of Sultan Mohammed Bigara (that famous 'Prince of Cambay' celebrated by Butler -- see under CAMBAY), at a cost of 3 lakhs of rupees. There is an elaborate model of a great Guzerati b\u0101ol\u012b in the Indian Museum at S. Kensington.\n We have seen in the suburbs of Palermo a regular b\u0101ol\u012b, excavated in the tufaceous rock that covers the plain. It was said to have been made at the expense of an ancestor of the present proprietor (Count Ranchibile) to employ people in a time of scarcity.\n c. 1343. -- \"There was also a b\u0101\u012bn, a name by which the Indians designate a very spacious kind of well, revetted with stone, and provided with steps for descent to the water's brink.

In Southern India and in China a native personal servant is so termed, and is habitually summoned with the vocative 'Boy!' The same was formerly common in Jamaica and other W. I. Islands. Similar uses are familiar of puer (e.g. in the Vulgate Dixit Giezi puer Viri Dei. II Kings v. 20), Ar. walad, PAIDA/RION, gar\u00e7on, knave (Germ. Knabe); and this same word is used for a camp-servant in Shakespeare, where Fluelen says: \"Kill the Poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly against the laws of arms.\" -- See also Grose's Mil. Antiquities, i. 183, and Latin quotation from Xavier under Conicopoly. The word, however, came to be especially used for 'Slave-boy,' and applied to slaves of any age.

[It is the andam or ba\u1e33\u1e33am of the Arabs (Burton, Ar. Nights, iii. 49).] The history of the word is very curious. For when the name was applied to the newly discovered region in S. America, probably, as Barros alleges, because it produced a dye-wood similar in character to the brazil of the East, the trade-name gradually became appropriated to the S. American product, and was taken away from that of the E. Indies. See some further remarks in Marco Polo, 2nd ed., ii. 368-370 [and Encycl.

But as it was through the symbol of the Cross that the Devil lost his dominion over us . . . as soon as the red wood called Brazil began to arrive from that country, he wrought that that name should abide in the mouth of the people, and that the name of Holy Cross should be lost, as if the name of a wood for colouring cloth were of more moment than that wood which imbues all the sacraments with the tincture of salvation, which is the Blood of Jesus Christ.\" -- Barros, I. v. 2.\n 1554. -- \"The baar (Bahar) of Brazil contains 20 fara\u00e7olas (see FRAZALA), weighing it in a coir rope, and there is no picotaa (see PICOTA)\" -- A.

But the first form has become classical from its constant occurrence in the Indian Despatches of Sir A. Wellesley. The word is properly H. banj\u0101r\u0101, and Wilson derives it from Skt. ba\u1e47ij, trade,' k\u0101ra, 'doer.' It is possible that the form brinj\u0101r\u0101 may have been suggested by a supposed connection with the Pers. birinj, 'rice.' (It is alleged in the Dict. of Words used in the E. Indies, 2nd ed., 1805, to be derived from brinj, 'rice,' and ara, 'bring'!) The Brinjarries of the Deccan are dealers in grain and salt, who move about, in numerous parties with cattle, carrying their goods to different markets, and who in the days of the Deccan wars were the great resource of the commissariat, as they followed the armies with supplies for sale. They talk a kind of Mahratta or Hindipatois. Most classes of Banj\u0101r\u0101s in the west appear to have a tradition of having first come to the Deccan with Moghul camps as commissariat carriers. In a pamphlet called Some Account of the Bunjarrah Class, by N. R. Cumberlege, District Sup. of Police, Basein, Berar (Bombay, 1882; [North Indian N. & Q. iv. 163 seqq.]), the author attempts to distinguish between brinjarees as 'grain-carriers,' and bunjarrahs, from bunj\u0101r, 'waste land' (meaning banjar or b\u0101nja\u1e5b). But this seems fanciful. In the N.-W. Provinces the name is also in use, and is applied to a numerous tribe spread along the skirt of the Him\u0101laya from Hardw\u0101r to Gorakhpur, some of whom are settled, whilst the rest move about with their cattle, sometimes transporting goods for hire, and sometimes carrying grain, salt, lime, forest produce, or other merchandise for sale. [See Crooke, Tribes and Castes, i. 149 seqq.] Vanj\u0101r\u0101s, as they are called about Bombay, used to come down from Rajput\u0101na and Central India, with large droves of cattle, laden with grain, &c., taking back with them salt for the most part.

The name of a vegetable called in the W. Indies the Egg-plant, and more commonly known to the English in Bengal under that of bangun (prop. baingan). It is the Solanum Melongena, L., very commonly cultivated on the shores of the Mediterranean as well as in India and the East generally. Though not known in a wild state under this form, there is no reasonable doubt that S.Melongena is a derivative of the common Indian S. insanum, L. The word in the form brinjaul is from the Portuguese, as we shall see. But probably there is no word of the kind which has undergone such extraordinary variety of modifications, whilst retaining the same meaning, as this. The Skt. is bha\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101k\u012b, H. bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101, baigan, baingan, P. bading\u0101n, badilg\u0101n, Ar. badinj\u0101n, Span. alberengena, berengena, Port. beringela, bringiela, bringella, Low Latin melangolus, merangolus, Ital. melangola, melanzana, mela insana, &c. (see P. della Valle, below), French aubergine (from alberengena), melong\u00e8ne,merang\u00e8ne, and provincially beling\u00e8ne, albergaine, albergine, albergame. (See Marcel Devic, p. 46.) Littr\u00e9, we may remark, explains (dormitante Homero?) aubergine as 'esp\u00e8ce de morelle,' giving the etym. as \"diminutif de auberge\" (in the sense of a kind of peach). Melongena is no real Latin word, but a factitious rendering of melanzana, or, as Marcel Devic says, \"Latin du botaniste.\" It looks as if the Skt. word were the original of all. The H. baingan again seems to have been modified from the P. bading\u0101n, [or, as Platts asserts, direct from the Skt. vanga, vangana, 'the plant of Bengal,'] and baingan also through the Ar. to have been the parent of the Span. berengena, and so of all the other European names except the English 'egg-plant.' The Ital. mela insana is the most curious of these corruptions, framed by the usual effort after meaning, and connecting itself with the somewhat indigestible reputation of the vegetable as it is eaten in Italy, which is a fact. When cholera is abroad it is considered (e.g. in Sicily) to be an act of folly to eat the melanzana.  There is, however, behind this, some notion (exemplified in the quotation from Lane's Mod. Egypt. below) connecting the badinj\u0101n with madness. [Burton, Ar. Nights, iii. 417.] And it would seem that the old Arab medical writers give it a bad character as an article of diet. Thus Avicenna says the badinj\u0101n generates melancholy and obstructions. To the N. O. Solanaceae many poisonous plants belong.\n The word has been carried, with the vegetable, to the Archipelago, probably by the Portuguese, for the Malays call it berinjal\u0101. [On this Mr. Skeat writes: \"The Malay form brinjal, from the Port., not b\u00e9rinjal\u0101, is given by Clifford and Swettenham, but it cannot be established as a Malay word, being almost certainly the Eng. brinjaul done into Malay. It finds no place in Klinkert, and the na\u1e6dive Malay word, which is the only word used in pure Peninsular Malay, is terong or trong. The form berinjal\u0101, I believe, must have come from the Islands if it really exists.\"]\n 1554. -- (At Goa). \"And the excise from garden stuff under which are comprised these things, viz.: Radishes, beetroot, garlick, onions green and dry, green tamarinds, lettuces, conbalinguas, ginger, oranges, dill, coriander, mint, cabbage, salted mangoes, brinjelas, lemons, gourds, citrons, cucumbers, which articles none may sell in retail except the Rendeiro of this excise, or some one who has got permission from him. . . .\" -- S.

A lumbering keelless barge, formerly much used by Europeans travelling on the Gangetic rivers. Two-thirds of the length aft was occupied by cabins with Venetian windows. Wilson gives the word as H. and B. bajr\u0101; Shakespear gives H. bajr\u0101 and bajra, with an improbable suggestion of derivation from bajar, 'hard or heavy.' Among Blochmann's extracts from Mahommedan accounts of the conquest of Assam we find, in a detail of M\u012br Jumla's fleet in his expedition of 1662, mention of 4 bajras (J. As. Soc. Ben. xli. pt. i. 73). The same extracts contain mention of war-sloops called bach'haris (pp. 57, 75, 81), but these last must be different. Bajra may possibly have been applied in the sense of 'thunder-bolt.' This may seem unsuited to the modern budgerow, but is not more so than the title of 'lightning-darter' is to the modern Burkundauze (q.v.)! We remember how Joinville says of the approach of the great galley of the Count of Jaffa: -- \"Sembloit que foudre cheist des ciex.\" It is however perhaps more probable that bajr\u0101 may have been a variation of bagl\u0101. And this is especially suggested by the existence of the Portuguese form pajeres, and of the Ar. form bagara (see under BUGGALOW). Mr. Edye, Master Shipwright of the Naval Yard in Trincomalee, in a paper on the Native Craft of India and Ceylon, speaks of the Baggala or Budgerow, as if he had been accustomed to hear the words used indiscriminately.

It was so in Lord Canning's time, then represented by a barge adapted to be towed by a steamer.\n", "budgrook": "s. Port. bazarucco. A coin of low denomination, and of varying value and metal (copper, tin, lead, and tutenague), formerly current at Goa and elsewhere on the Western Coast, as well as at some other places on the Indian seas. It was also adopted from the Portuguese in the earliest English coinage at Bombay. In the earliest Goa coinage, that of Albuquerque (1510), the leal or bazarucco was equal to 2 reis, of which reis there went 420 to the gold cruzado (Gerson da Cunha). The name appears to have been a native one in use in Goa at the time of the conquest, but its etymology is uncertain. In Van Noort's Voyage (1648) the word is derived from b\u0101z\u0101r, and said to mean 'market-money' (perhaps b\u0101z\u0101r-r\u016bka, the last word being used for a copper coin in Canarese). [This view is accepted by Gray in his notes on Pyrard (Hak. Soc. ii. 68), and by Burnell (Linschoten, Hak. Soc. ii. 143). The Madras, Admin. Man. Gloss. (s.v.) gives the Can. form as baj\u0101ra-rokkha, 'marketmoney.'] C. P. Brown (MS. notes) makes the word=ba\u1e0daga-r\u016bka, which he says would in Canarese be 'basepenny,' and he ingeniously quotes Shakspeare's \"beggarly denier,\" and Horace's \"vilem assem.\" This is adopted in substance by Mr. E. Thomas, who points out that ruk\u0101 or rukk\u0101 is in Mahratti (see Molesworth, s.v.) one-twelfth of an anna. But the words of Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n below suggest that the word may be a corruption of the P. buzurg, 'big,' and according to Wilson, budr\u016bkh (s.v.) is used in Mahratti as a dialectic corruption of buz\u016brg. This derivation may be partially corroborated by the fact that at Mocha there is, or was formerly, a coin (which had become a money of account only, 80 to the dollar) called kab\u012br, i.e. 'big' (see Ovington, 463, and Milburn, i. 98). If we could attach any value to Pyrard's spelling- bousuruques -- this would be in favour of the same etymology; as is also the form besorg given by Mandelslo.

This is of course originally from the Latin bubalus, which we have in older English forms, buffle and buff and bugle, through the French. The present form probably came from India, as it seems to be the Port. bufalo. The proper meaning of bubalus, according to Pliny, was not an animal of the ox-kind (BOO/BALIS was a kind of African antelope); but in Martial, as quoted, it would seem to bear the vulgar sense, rejected by Pliny.\n At an early period of our connection with India the name of buffalo appears to have been given erroneously to the common Indian ox, whence came the still surviving misnomer of London shops, 'buffalo humps.' (See also the quotation from Ovington.) The buffalo has no hump. Buffalo tongues are another matter, and an old luxury, as the third quotation shows. The ox having appropriated the name of the buffalo, the true Indian domestic buffalo was differentiated as the 'water buffalo,' a phrase still maintained by the British soldier in India. This has probably misled Mr. Blochmann, who uses the term 'water buffalo,' in his excellent English version of the \u0100\u012bn (e.g. i. 219). We find the same phrase in Barkley's Five Years in Bulgaria, 1876: \"Besides their bullocks every well-to-do Turk had a drove of waterbuffaloes\" (32). Also in Collingwood's Rambles of a Naturalist (1868), p. 43, and in Miss Bird's Golden Chersonese (1883), 60, 274. [The unscientific use of the word as applied to the American Bison is as old as the end of the 18th century (see N.E.D.).]\n The domestic buffalo is apparently derived from the wild buffalo (Bubalus arni, Jerd.; Bos bubalus, Blanf.), whose favourite habitat is in the swampy sites of the Sunderbunds and Eastern Bengal, but whose hauntsextend north-eastward to the head of the Assam valley, in the Terai west to Oudh, and south nearly to the Godavery; not beyond this in the Peninsula, though the animal is found in the north and north-east of Ceylon.\n The domestic buffalo exists not only in India but in Java, Sumatra, and Manilla, in Mazanderan, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Adherbijan, Egypt, Turkey, and Italy.

It is also in common use in the Red Sea (ba\u1e33al\u0101) for the larger native vessels, all built of teak from India. It seems to be a corruption of the Span. and Port. bajel, baxel, baixel, baxella, from the Lat. vascellum (see Diez, Etym. W\u00f6rterb. i. 439, s. v.). Cobarruvias (1611) gives in his Sp. Dict. \"Baxel, quasi vasel\" as a generic name for a vessel of any kind going on the sea, and quotes St. Isidore, who identifies it with phaselus, and from whom we transcribe the passage below. It remains doubtful whether this word was introduced into the East by the Portuguese, or had at an earlier date passed into Arabic marine use. The latter is most probable. In Correa (c. 1561) this word occurs in the form pajer, pl. pajeres (j and x being interchangeable in Sp. and Port. See Lendas, i. 2, pp. 592, 619, &c.). In Pinto we have another form. Among the models in the Fisheries Exhibition (1883), there was \"A Zaroogat or Bagarah from Aden.\" [On the other hand Burton (Ar. Nights, i. 119) derives the word from the Ar. baghlah, 'a she-mule.'

In India this is a (two-wheeled) gig with a hood, like the gentleman's cab that was in vogue in London about 1830-40, before broughams came in. Latham puts a (?) after the word, and the earliest examples that he gives are from the second quarter of this century (from Praed and I. D'Israeli). Though we trace the word much further back, we have not discovered its birthplace or etymology. The word, though used in England, has never been very common there; it is better known both in Ireland and in America. Littr\u00e9 gives boghei as French also. The American buggy is defined by Noah Webster as \"a light, one-horse, four-wheel vehicle, usually with one seat, and with or without a calash-top.\" Cuthbert Bede shows (N. & Q. 5 ser. v. p. 445) that the adjective 'buggy' is used in the Eastern Midlands for 'conceited.' This suggests a possible origin. \"When the Hunterian spelling-controversy raged in India, a learned Member of Council is said to have stated that he approved the change until --- --- began to spell buggy as bag\u012b. Then he gave it up.\" -- (M.-G. Keatinge.) I have recently seen this spelling in print. [The N.E.D. leaves the etymology unsettled, merely saying that it has been connected with bogie and bug.

The word bulbul is originally Persian (no doubt intended to imitate the bird's note), and applied to a bird which does duty with Persian poets for the nightingale. Whatever the Persian bulbul may be correctly, the application of the name to certain species in India \"has led to many misconceptions about their powers of voice and song,\" says Jerdon. These species belong to the family Brachipodidae, or short-legged thrushes, and the true bulbuls to the sub-family Pycnonotinae, e.g. genera Hypsipetes, Hemixos, Alcurus, Criniger, Ixos, Kelaartia, Rubigula, Brachipodius, Otocompsa, Pycnonotus (P. pygaeus, common Bengal Bulbul; P. haemorhous, common Madras Bulbul). Another sub-family, Phyllornithinae, contains various species which Jerdon calls green Bulbuls.\n [A lady having asked the late Lord Robertson, a Judge of the Court of Session, \"What sort of animal is the bull-bull?\" he replied, \"I suppose, Ma'am, it must be the mate of the coo-coo.\" -- 3rd ser., N. & Q. v. 81.]\n 1784. -- \"We are literally lulled to sleep by Persian nightingales, and cease to wonder that the Bulbul, with a thousand tales, makes such a figure in Persian poetry.\"- Sir W.

The general Asiatic name for what we call 'Russia leather,' from the fact that the region of manufacture and export was originally Bolgh\u0101r on the Volga, a kingdom which stood for many centuries, and gave place to Kazan in the beginning of the 15th century. The word was usual also among Anglo-Indians till the beginning of last century, and is still in native Hindustani use. A native (mythical) account of the manufacture is given in Baden - Powell's Punjab Handbook, 1872, and this fanciful etymology: \"as the scent is derived from soaking in the pits (gh\u0101r), the leather is called Balgh\u0101r\" (p. 124).\n 1298. -- \"He bestows on each of those 12,000 Barons . . . likewise a pair of boots of Borgal, curiously wrought with silver thread.\" -- Marco Polo, 2nd ed. i. 381.

H. bamba, from Port. bomba, 'a pump.' Haex (1631) gives: \"Bomba, organum pneumaticum quo aqua hauritur,\" as a Malay word. This is incorrect, of course, as to the origin of the word, but it shows its early adoption into an Eastern language. The word is applied at Ahmedabad to the watertowers, but this is modern; [and so is the general application of the word in N. India to a canal distributary].\n 1572. --  \" Alija, disse o mestre rijamente, Alija tudo ao mar, na\u0303o falte acordo Va\u0303o outros dar \u00e1 bomba, na\u0303o cessando; A' bomba que nos imos alagando.'\" Cam\u00f5es, vi. 72.\n By Burton: ''Heave!' roared the Master with a mighty roar, 'Heave overboard your all, together's the word!

A small fish, abounding on all the coasts of India and the Archipelago; Harpodon nehereus of Buch. Hamilton; the specific name being taken from the Bengali name nehare. The fish is a great delicacy when fresh caught and fried. When dried it becomes the famous Bombay Duck (see DUCKS, BOMBAY), which is now imported into England.\n The origin of either name is obscure. Molesworth gives the word as Mahratti with the spelling bomb\u012bl, or bomb\u012bla (p. 595 a). Bummelo occurs in the Supp. (1727) to Bluteau's Dict. in the Portuguese form bambulim, as \"the name of a very savoury fish in India.\" The same word bambulim is also explained to mean 'humas pregas na saya a moda,' 'certain plaits in the fashionable ruff,' but we know not if there is any connection between the two. The form Bombay Duck has an analogy to Digby Chicks which are sold in the London shops, also a kind of dried fish, pilchards we believe, and the name may have originated in imitation of this or some similar English name. [The Digby Chick is said to be a small herring cured in a peculiar manner at Digby, in Lincolnshire: but the Americans derive them from Digby in Nova Scotia; see 8 ser.

Sir Arthur Phayre considers that this name was in all probability adopted by the Mongoloid tribes of the Upper Irawadi, on their conversion to Buddhism by missionaries from Gangetic India, and is identical with that (Br\u0101m-m\u0101) by which the first and holy inhabitants of the world are styled in the (Pali) Buddhist Scriptures. Brahma-desa was the term applied to the country by a Singhalese monk returning thence to Ceylon, in conversation with one of the present writers. It is however the view of Bp. Bigandet and of Prof. Forchhammer, supported by considerable arguments, that Mran, Myan, or Myen was the original name of the Burmese people, and is traceable in the names given to them by their neighbours; e.g. by Chinese Mien (and in Marco Polo); by Kakhyens, Myen or Mren; by Shans, M\u0101n; by Sgaw Karens, Payo; by Pgaw Karens, Pay\u0101n; by Paloungs, Par\u0101n, &c.* Prof. F. considers that Mran-m\u0101 (with this honorific suffix) does not date beyond the 14th century. [In J. R A. Soc.

Peculiar meanings are also attached to words; thus family = 'wife.' The oddest characteristic about this jargon is (or was) that masters used it in speaking to their servants as well as servants to their masters.\n", "buxee": "s. A military paymaster; H. bakhsh\u012b. This is a word of complex and curious history.\n In origin it is believed to be the Mongol or Turki corruption of the Skt. bhikshu, 'a beggar,' and thence a Buddhist or religious mendicant or member of the ascetic order, bound by his discipline to obtain his daily food by begging.* Bakshi was the word commonly applied by the Tartars of the host of Chingiz and his successors, and after them by the Persian writers of the Mongol era, to the regular Buddhist clergy; and thus the word appears under various forms in the works of medieval European writers from whom examples are quoted below. Many of the class came to Persia and the west with Hul\u0101k\u016b and with B\u0101t\u016b Kh\u0101n; and as the writers in the Tartar camps were probably found chiefly among the bakshis, the word underwent exactly the same transfer of meaning as our clerk, and came to signify a literatus, scribe or secretary. Thus in the Latino-Perso-Turkish vocabulary, which belonged to Petrarch and is preserved at Venice, the word scriba is rendered in Comanian, i.e. the then Turkish of the Crimea, as Bacsi. The change of meaning did not stop here.\n Abu'l-Fa\u1e93l in his account of Kashm\u012br (in the \u0100\u012bn, [ed. Jarrett, iii. 212]) recalls the fact that bakhsh\u012b was the title given by the learned among Persian and Arabic writers to the Buddhist priests whom the Tibetans styled l\u0101m\u0101s. But in the time of Baber, say circa 1500, among the Mongols the word had come to mean surgeon; a change analogous again, in some measure, to our colloquial use of doctor. The modern Mongols, according to Pallas, use the word in the sense of 'Teacher,' and apply it to the most venerable or learned priest of a community. Among In a note with which we were favoured by the late Prof. Anton Schiefner, he expressed doubts whether the Bakshi of the Tibetans and Mongols was not of early introduction through the Uigurs from some other corrupted Sanskrit word, or even of prae-buddhistic derivation from an Iranian source. We do not find the word in Jaeschke s Tibetan Dictionary.\n the Kirghiz Kazz\u0101ks, who profess Mahommedanism, it has come to bear the character which Marco Polo more or less associates with it, and means a mere conjurer or medicine-man; whilst in Western Turkestan it signifies a 'Bard' or 'Minstrel.' [Vamb\u00e9ry in his Sketches of Central Asia (p. 81) speaks of a Bakhshi as a troubadour.]\n By a further transfer of meaning, of which all the steps are not clear, in another direction, under the Mohammedan Emperors of India the word bakhshi was applied to an officer high in military administration, whose office is sometimes rendered 'Master of the Horse' (of horse, it is to be remembered, the whole substance of the army consisted), but whose duties sometimes, if not habitually, embraced those of Paymaster-General, as well as, in a manner, of Commander-in-Chief, or Chief of the Staff. [Mr. Irvine, who gives a detailed account of the Bakhshi under the latter Moguls (J. R. A. Soc., July 1896, p. 539 seqq.), prefers to call him Adjutant-General.] More properly perhaps this was the position of the M\u012br Bakhsh\u012b, who had other bakhsh\u012bs under him. Bakhsh\u012bs in military command continued in the armies of the Mahrattas, of Hyder Ali, and of other native powers. But both the Persian spelling and the modern connection of the title with pay indicate a probability that some confusion of association had arisen between the old Tartar title and the P. bakhsh, 'portion,' bakhsh\u012bdan, 'to give,' bakhsh\u012bsh, 'payment.' In the early days of the Council of Fort William we find the title Buxee applied to a European Civil officer, through whom payments were made (see Long and Seton-Karr, passim). This is obsolete, but the word is still in the Anglo-Indian Army the recognised designation of a Paymaster.\n This is the best known existing use of the word. But under some Native Governments it is still the designation of a high officer of state. And according to the Calcutta Glossary it has been used in the N.W.P. for 'a collector of a house tax' (?) and the like; in Bengal for 'a superintendent of peons'; in Mysore for 'a treasurer,' &c. [In the N.W.P. the Bakhsh\u012b, popularly known to natives as 'Bakhsh\u012b Tikkas,' 'Tax Bakhshi,' is the person in charge of one of the minor towns which are not under a Municipal Board, but are managed by a Panch, or body of assessors, who raise the income needed for watch and ward and conservancy by means of a graduated house assessment. ] See an interesting note on this word in Quatrem\u00e8re, H. desMongols, 184 seqq.; also see Marco Polo, Bk. i. ch. 61, note.\n 1298. -- \"There is another marvel performed by those Bacsi, of whom I have been speaking as knowing so many enchantments. . . .\" -- Marco Polo, Bk.

A matchlock man; apparently used in much the same sense as Burkundauze (q.v.) now obsolete. We have not found this term excepting in documents pertaining to the middle decades of 18th century in Bengal; [but see references supplied by Mr. Irvine below;] nor have we found any satisfactory etymology. Buxo is in Port. a gun-barrel (Germ. Buchse); which suggests some possible word buxeiro. There is however none such in Bluteau, who has, on the other hand, \"Butgeros, an Indian term, artillery-men, &c.,\" and quotes from Hist. Orient. iii. 7: \"Butgeri sunt hi qui quinque tormentis praeficiuntur.\" This does not throw much light. Bajjar, 'thunderbolt,' may have given vogue to a word in analogy to P. bar\u1e33and\u0101z, 'lightning-darter,' but we find no such word. As an additional conjecture, however, we may suggest Baks\u0101ris, from the possible circumstance that such men were recruited in the country about Baks\u0101r (Buxar), i.e. the Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d district, which up to 1857 was a great recruiting ground for sepoys. [There can be no doubt that this last suggestion gives the correct origin of the word.

A note by Kirkpatrick to the passage below from Tippoo's Letters says Byde Horse are \"the same as Pinda\u0302rehs, Looties, and Kuzza\u0302ks\" (see PINDARRY, LOOTY, COSSACK). In the Life of Hyder Ali by Hussain 'Ali Kh\u0101n Kirm\u0101ni, tr. by Miles, we read that Hyder's Kuzzaks were under the command of \"Ghazi Khan Bede.\" But whether this leader was so called from leading the \"Bede\" Horse, or gave his name to them, does not appear. Miles has the highly intelligent note: 'Bede is another name for (Kuzzak): Kirkpatrick supposed the word Bede meant infantry, which, I believe, it does not' (p. 36). The quotation from the Life of Tippoo seems to indicate that it was the name of a caste. And we find in Sherring's Indian Tribes and Castes, among those of Mysore, mention of the Bedar as a tribe, probably of huntsmen, dark, tall, and warlike. Formerly many were employed as soldiers, and served in Hyder's wars (iii. 153; see also the same tribe in the S. Mahratta country, ii. 321). Assuming -ar to be a plural sign, we have here probably the \"Bedes\" who gave their name to these plundering horse. The Bedar are mentioned as one of the predatory classes of the peninsula, along with Marawars, Kallars, Ram\u016bsis (see RAMOOSY), &c., in Sir Walter Elliot's paper (J. Ethnol. Soc., 1869, N.S. pp. 112-13). But more will be found regarding them in a paper by the late Gen. Briggs, the translator of Ferishta's Hist. (J. R. A. Soc. xiii.). Besides Bedar, Bednor (or Nagar) in Mysore seems to take its name from this tribe. [See Rice, Mysore, i. 255.]\n 1758. -- \". . .

A small two-wheeled vehicle drawn by two oxen. H. bahal, bahl\u012b, bail\u012b, which has no connection, as is generally supposed, with bail, 'an ox'; but is derived from the Skt. vah, 'to carry.' The bylee is used only for passengers, and a larger and more imposing vehicle of the same class is the Rut. There is a good drawing of a Panjab bylee in Kipling's Beast and Man (p. 117); also see the note on the quotation from Forbes under HACKERY.\n [1841. -- \"A native bylee will usually produce, in gold and silver of great purity, ten times the weight of precious metals to be obtained from a general officer's equipage.\" -- Society in India, i. 162.\n [1854. -- \"Most of the party . . . were in a barouch, but the rich man himself [one of the Muttra Seths] still adheres to the primitive conveyance of a bylis, a thing like a footboard on two wheels, generally drawn by two oxen, but in which he drives a splendid pair of white horses, sitting crosslegged the while!\" -- Mrs Mackenzie, Life in the Mission, &c., ii. 205.]\n C"}
