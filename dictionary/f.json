{"factor": "s. Originally a commercial agent; the executive head of a factory. Till some 55 years ago the Factors formed the third of the four classes into which the covenanted civil servants of the Company were theoretically divided, viz. Senior Merchants, Junior Merchants, factors and writers. But these terms had long ceased to have any relation to the occupation of these officials, and even to have any application at all except in the nominal lists of the service. The titles, how ever, continue (through vis inertiae of administration in such matters) in the classified lists of the Civil Service for years after the abolition of the last vestige of the Company's trading character, and it is not till the publication of the E. I. Register for the first half of 1842 that they disappear from that official publication. In this the whole body appears without any classification; and in that for the second half of 1842 they are divided into six classes, first class, second class, &c., an arrangement which, with the omission of the 6th class, still continues. Possibly the expressions Factor, Factory, may have been adopted from the Portuguese Feitor, Feitoria. The formal authority for the classification of the civilians is quoted under 1675.\n 1501. -- \"With which answer night came on, and there came aboard the Captain M\u00f3r that Christian of Calecut sent by the Factor (feitor) to say that Cojebequi assured him, and he knew it to be the case, that the King of Calecut was arming a great fleet.' -- Correa, i. 250.\n 1582. -- \"The Factor and the Catuall having seen these parcels began to laugh thereat.\" -- Casta\u00f1eda, tr. by N.

The form fanam was probably of Arabic origin, as we find it long prior to the Portuguese period. The fanam was anciently a gold coin, but latterly of silver, or sometimes of base gold. It bore various local values, but according to the old Madras monetary system, prevailing till 1818, 42 fanams went to one star pagoda, and a Madras fanam was therefore worth about 2d. (see Prinsep's Useful Tables, by E. Thomas, p. 18). The weights of a large number of ancient fanams given by Mr. Thomas in a note to his Pathan Kings of Delhi show that the average weight was 6 grs. of gold (p. 170). Fanams are still met with on the west coast, and as late as 1862 were received at the treasuries of Malabar and Calicut. As the coins were very small they used to be counted by means of a small board or dish, having a large number of holes or pits. On this a pile of fanams was shaken, and then swept off, leaving the holes filled. About the time named Rs. 5000 worth of gold fanams were sold off at those treasuries.

A denomination of money formerly current in Bombay and the adjoining coast; Mahr. p'hady\u0101 (qu. Ar. fidya, ransom?). It constantly occurs in the account statements of the 16th century, e.g. of Nunez (1554) as a money of account, of which 4 went to the silver tanga, [see TANGA] 20 to the Pardao. In Milburn (1813) it is a pice or copper coin, of which 50 went to a rupee. Prof. Robertson Smith suggests that this may be the Ar. denomination of a small coin used in Egypt, fa\u1e0d\u1e0da (i.e. 'silverling'). It may be an objection that the letter \u1e93w\u0101d used in that word is generally pronounced in India as a z. The Fa\u1e0d\u1e0da is the Turkish p\u0101ra, 1\u204440 of a piastre, an infinitesimal value now. [Burton (Arabian Nights, xi. 98) gives 2000 faddahs as equal about 1s. 2d.] But, according to Lane, the name was originally given to half-dirhems, coined early in the 15th century, and these would be worth about 5\u2154d.

They represent a reaction and protest against the corrupt condition and pagan practices into which Mahom medanism in Eastern India had fallen, analogous to the former decay of native Christianity in the south (see MALABAR RITES). This reaction was begun by Hajji Shar\u012byatullah, a native of the village of Daulatp\u016br, in the district of Far\u012bdp\u016br, who was killed in an agrarian riot in 1831.

Since his death, some 35 years ago, the influence of the body is said to have diminished, but it had spread very largely through Lower Bengal. The Far\u0101i\u1e93\u012b wraps his dhoty (q.v.) round his loins, without crossing it between his legs, a practice which he regards as heathenish, as a Bedouin would.\n", "ferozeshuhur": "n.p. The last of these appears to be the correct representation of this name of the scene of the hard-fought battle of 21st-22nd December, 1845. For, according to Col. R. C. Temple, the Editor of Panjab Notes and Queries, ii. 116 (1885), the village was named after Bh\u0101\u012b Pher\u016b, a Sikh saint of the beginning of the century, who lies buried at M\u012b\u0101n-ke-Ta\u1e25\u1e63\u012bl in Lahore District.\n", "fetish": "s. A natural object, or animal, made an object of worship. From Port. feti\u00e7o, feiti\u00e7o, or fetisso (old Span. fechizo), apparently from factitius, signifying first 'artificial,' and then 'unnatural,' 'wrought by charms,' &c. The word is not Anglo-Indian; but it was at an early date applied by the Portuguese to the magical figures, &c., used by natives in Africa and India, and has thence been adopted into French and English. The word has of late years acquired a special and technical meaning, chiefly through the writings of Comte. [See Jevons, Intr. to the Science of Rel. 166 seqq.] Raynouard (Lex. Roman.) has fachurier, fachilador, for 'a sorcerer,' which he places under fat, i.e. fatum, and cites old Catalan fadador, old Span. hadador, and then Port. feiticeiro, &c. But he has mixed up the derivatives of two different words, fatum and factitius.  Prof. Max M\u00fcller quotes, from Muratori, a work of 1311 which has: \"incantationes, sacrilegia, auguria, vel malefica, quae facturae seu praestigia vulgariter appellantur.\" And Raynouard himself has in a French passage of 1446: \"par leurs sorceries et faictureries.\"\n 1487. -- \"E assi lhe (a el Rey de Beni) mandou muitos e santos conselhos pera tornar \u00e1 F\u00e9 de Nosso Senhor . . . mandandolhe muito estranhar suas idolotrias e feiti\u00e7arias, que em suas terras os negros tinha\u0303o e usa\u0303o.\" -- Garcia, Resende, Chron. of Dom.

Called in South Indian vernaculars by names signifying 'Lightning Insect.'\n A curious question has been discussed among entomologists, &c., of late years, viz. as to the truth of the alleged rhythmical or synchronous flashing of fireflies when visible in great numbers. Both the present writers can testify to the fact of a distinct effect of this kind. One of them can never forget an instance in which he witnessed it, twenty years or more before he was aware that any one had published, or questioned, the fact. It was in descending the Ch\u0101ndor Gha\u0303t, in N\u0101sik District of the Bombay Presidency, in the end of May or beginning of June 1843, during a fine night preceding the rains. There was a large amphitheatre of forest-covered hills, and every leaf of every tree seemed to bear a firefly. They flashed and intermitted throughout the whole area in apparent rhythm and sympathy. It is, we suppose, possible that this may have been a deceptive impression, though it is difficult to see how it could originate. The suggestions made at the meetings of the Entomological Society are utterly unsatisfactory to those who have observed the phenomenon. In fact it may be said that those suggested explanations only assume that the soidisant observers did not observe what they alleged. We quote several independent testimonies to the phenomenon.\n 1579. -- \"Among these trees, night by night, did show themselues an infinite swarme of fierie seeming wormes flying in the aire, whose bodies (no bigger than an ordinarie flie) did make a shew, and giue such light as euery twigge on euery tree had beene a lighted candle, or as if that place had beene the starry spheare.\" -- Drake's Voyage, by F. Fletcher, Hak. Soc. 149.\n 1675. -- \"We . . . left our Burnt Wood on the Right-hand, but entred another made us better Sport, deluding us with false Flashes, that you would have thought the Trees on a Flame, and presently, as if untouch'd by Fire, they retained their wonted Verdure. The Coolies beheld the Sight with Horror and Amazement . . . where we found an Host of Flies, the Subject both of our Fear and Wonder. . . . This gave my Thoughts the Contemplation of that Miraculous Bush crowned with Innocent Flames, . . . the Fire that consumes everything seeming rather to dress than offend it.\" -- Fryer, 141-142.\n 1682. -- \"Fireflies (de vuur-vliegen) are so called by us because at eventide, whenever they fly they burn so like fire, that from a distance one fancies to see so many lanterns; in fact they give light enough to write by. . . . They gather in the rainy season in great multitudes in the bushes and trees, and live on the flowers of the trees. There are various kinds.\" -- Nieuhoff, ii. 291.\n 1764.- \"Ere fireflies trimmed their vital lamps, and ere Dun Evening trod on rapid Twilight's heel, His knell was rung.\" -- Grainger, Bk. I.\n 1824.- \"Yet mark! as fade the upper skies, Each thicket opes ten thousand eyes.

These flashes succeed one another every 3 or 4 seconds for about 10 minutes, when an interval of similar duration takes place; as if to allow the insects to regain their electric or phosphoric vigour.\" -- Cameron Our Tropical Possessions in Malayan India, 80-81.\n The passage quoted from Mr. Cameron's book was read at the Entom. Soc. of London in May 1865, by the Rev. Hamlet Clarke, who added that:\n \"Though he was utterly unable to give an explanation of the phenomenon, he could so far corroborate Mr. Cameron as to say that he had himself witnessed this simultaneous flashing; he had a vivid recollection of a particular glen in the Organ Mountains where he had on several occasions noticed the contemporaneous exhibition of their light by numerous individuals, as if they were acting in concert.\"\n Mr. McLachlan then suggested that this might be caused by currents of wind, which by inducing a number of the insects simultaneously to change the direction of their flight, might occasion a momentary concealment of their light.\n Mr. Bates had never in his experience received the impression of any simultaneous flashing. . . . he regarded the contemporaneous flashing as an illusion produced probably by the swarms of insects flying among foliage, and being continually, but only momentarily, hidden behind the leaves. -- Proc. Entom. Soc. of London, 1865, pp. 94-95.\n Fifteen years later at the same Society:\n \"Sir Sidney Saunders stated that in the South of Europe (Corfu and Albania) the simultaneous flashing of Luciola italica, with intervals of complete darkness for some seconds, was constantly witnessed in the dark summer nights, when swarming myriads were to be seen. . . . He did not concur in the hypothesis propounded by Mr. McLachlan . . . the flashes are certainly intermittent . . . the simultaneous character of these coruscations among vast swarms would seem to depend upon an instinctive impulse to emit their light at certain intervals as a protective influence, which intervals became assimilated to each other by imitative emulation. But whatever be the causes . . . the fact itself was incontestable.\" -- Ibid. for 1880, Feby. 24, p. ii.; see also p. vii.\n 1868. -- \"At Singapore . . . the little luminous beetle commonly known as the firefly (Lampyris, sp. ign.) is common . . . clustered in the foliage of the trees, instead of keeping up an irregular twinkle, every individual shines simultaneously at regular intervals, as though by a common impulse; so that their light pulsates, as it were, and the tree is for one moment illuminated by a hundred brilliant points, and the next is almost in total darkness. The intervals have about the duration of a second, and during the intermission only one or two remain luminous.\" -- Collingwood, Rambles of a Naturalist, p. 255.\n 1880. -- \"HARBINGERS OF THE MONSOON. -- One of the surest indications of the approach of the monsoon is the spectacle presented nightly in the Mawul taluka, that is, at Khandalla and Lanoli, where the trees are filled with myriads of fireflies, which flash their phosphoric light simultaneously. Each tree suddenly flashes from bottom to top. Thousands of trees presenting this appearance simultaneously, afford a spectacle beautiful, if not grand, beyond conception. This little insect, the female of its kind, only appears and displays its brilliant light immediately before the monsoon.\" -- Deccan Herald. (From Pioneer Mail, June 17).\n", "firinghee": "s. Pers. Farang\u012b, Firing\u012b; Ar. Al-Faranj, Ifranj\u012b, Firanj\u012b, i.e. a Frank. This term for a European is very old in Asia, but when now employed by natives in India is either applied (especially in the South) specifically to the Indian-born Portuguese, or, when used more generally, for 'European,' implies something of hostility or disparagement. (See Sonnerat and Elphinstone below.) In South India the Tamil P'arangi, the Singhalese Parangi, mean only 'Portuguese,' [or natives converted by the Portuguese, or by Mahommedans, any European (Madras Gloss. s.v.).

[The N.E.D. gives the primary idea as \"something attached by the edge,\" as a strip on a garment to cover the button-holes.] A tent such as officers generally use has two flies, for better protection from sun and rain. The vertical canvas walls are called Kan\u0101t (see CANAUT). [Another sense of the word is \"a quick-travelling carriage\" (see quotation in Forbes below).]\n [1784. -- \"We all followed in fly-palanquins.\" -- Sir J. Day, in Forbes, Or.

Popular name of the great bat (Pteropus Edwardsi, Geoff). In the daytime these bats roost in large colonies, hundreds or thousands of them pendent from the branches of some great ficus. Jerdon says of these bats: \"If water is at hand, a tank, or river, or the sea, they fly cautiously down and touch the water, but I could not ascertain if they took a sip, or merely dipped part of their bodies in\" (Mammals of India, p. 18). The truth is, as Sir George Yule has told us from his own observation, that the bat in its skimming flight dips its breast in the water, and then imbibes the moisture from its own wet fur. Probably this is the first record of a curious fact in natural history. \"I have been positively assured by natives that on the Odeypore lake in Rajputana, the crocodiles rise to catch these bats, as they follow in line, touching the water. Fancy flyfishing for crocodile with such a fly!\" (Communication from M.-Gen. R. H. Keatinge.) [On the other hand Mr. Blanford says: \"I have often observed this habit: the head is lowered, the animal pauses in its flight, and the water is just touched, I believe, by the tongue or lower jaw. I have no doubt that some water is drunk, and this is the opinion of both Tickell and M'Master. The former says that flying-foxes in confinement drink at all hours, lapping with their tongues. The latter has noticed many other bats drink in the evening as well as the flying-foxes.\" (Mammalia of India, 258).]\n 1298. -- \". . . all over India the birds and beasts are entirely different from ours, all but . . . the Quail. . . . For example, they have bats -- I mean those birds that fly by night and have no feathers of any kind; well, their birds of this kind are as big as a goshawk!\" -- Marco Polo, Bk. iii. ch. 17.\n c. 1328. -- \"There be also bats really and truly as big as kites. These birds fly nowhither by day, but only when the sun sets. Wonderful! By day they hang themselves up on trees by the feet, with their bodies downwards, and in the daytime they look just like big fruit on the tree.\" -- Friar Jordanus, p. 19.\n 1555. -- \"On the road we occasionally saw trees whose top reached the skies, and on which one saw marvellous bats, whose wings stretched some 14 palms.

Fool Rack is originally, as will be seen from Garcia and Acosta, the name of the strongest distillation from toddy or sura, the 'flower' (p'h\u016bl, in H. and Mahr.) of the spirit. But the 'striving after meaning' caused the English corruption of this name to be applied to a peculiarly abominable and pernicious spirit, in which, according to the statement of various old writers, the stinging sea-blubber was mixed, or even a distillation of the same, with a view of making it more ardent.\n 1563. -- \". . . this \u00e7ura they distil like brandy (agua ardente): and the result is a liquor like brandy; and a rag steeped in this will burn as in the case of brandy; and this fine spirit they call fula, which means 'flower'; and the other quality that remains they call orraca, mixing with it a small quantity of the first kind. . . .\" -- Garcia, f. 67.\n 1578. -- \". . . la qual (sura) en vasos despues distilan, para hazer agua ardiente, de la qual una, a que ellos llaman Fula, que quiere dezir 'flor,' es m\u00e0s fina . . . y la segunda, que llaman Orraca, no tanto.\"- Acosta, p. 101.\n 1598. -- \"This Sura being [beeing] distilled, is called Fula or Nipe [see NIPA], and is as excellent aqua vitae as any is made in Dort of their best renish [rennish] wine, but this is of the finest kinde of distillation.\"- Linschoten, 101; [Hak.

This is a term peculiar to the island of Bombay, and an inheritance from the Portuguese. They are lands reclaimed from the sea, by the construction of the Vellard (q.v.) at Breech-Candy, and other embankments, on which account they are also known as 'Salt Batty [see BATTA] (i.e. rice) -grounds.' The Court of Directors, to encourage reclamation, in 1703 authorised these lands to be leased rent-free to the reclaimers for a number of years, after which a small quit-rent was to be fixed. But as individuals would not undertake the maintenance of the embankments, the Government stepped in and constructed the Vellard at considerable expense. The lands were then let on terms calculated to compensate the Government. The tenure of the lands, under these circumstances, for many years gave rise to disputes and litigation as to tenantright, the right of Government to resume, and other like subjects. The lands were known by the title Foras, from the peculiar tenure, which should perhaps be Foros, from foro, 'a quitrent. ' The Indian Act VI. of 1851 arranged for the termination of these differences, by extinguishing the disputed rights of Government, except in regard to lands taken up for public purposes, and by the constitution of a Foras Land Commission to settle the whole matter. This work was completed by October 1853. The roads from the Fort crossing the \"Flats,\" or Foras Lands, between Malabar Hill and Parell were generally known as \"the Foras Roads\"; but this name seems to have passed away, and the Municipal Commissioners have superseded that general title by such names as Clerk Road, Bellasis Road, Falkland Road. One name, 'Comattee-poora Forest Road,' perhaps preserves the old generic title under a disguise.\n Forasd\u0101rs are the holders of Foras Lands. See on the whole matter Bombay Selections, No. III., New Series, 1854. The following quaint quotation is from a petition of Forasd\u0101rs of Mahim and other places regarding some points in the working of the Commission:\n 1852. -- \". . . that the case with respect to the old and new salt batty grounds, may it please your Honble. Board to consider deeply, is totally different, because in their original state the grounds were not of the nature of other sweet waste grounds on the island, let out as foras, nor these grounds were of that state as one could saddle himself at the first undertaking thereof with leases or grants even for that smaller rent as the foras is under the denomination of foras is same other denomination to it, because the depth of these grounds at the time when sea-water was running over them was so much that they were a perfect sea-bay, admitting fishing-boats to float towards Parell.\" -- In Selections, as above, p. 29.\n", "foujdar": "&c., s.
