{"jack": "s. Short for Jack-Sepoy ; in former days a familiar style for the native soldier; kindly, rather than otherwise.\n 1853. -- \". . . he should be leading the Jacks.\" -- Oakfield, ii. 66.\n J A C K, s. The tree called by botanists Artocarpus integrifolia, L. fil., and its fruit. The name, says Drury, is \"a corruption of the Skt. word Tchackka, which means the fruit of the tree\" (Useful Plants, p. 55). There is, however, no such Skt. word; the Skt. names are Kantaka, Phala, Panasa, and Phalasa. [But the Malay\u0101l. chakka is from the Skt. chakra, 'round.'] Rheede rightly gives Tsjaka (ch\u0103kka) as the Malay\u0101lam name, and from this no doubt the Portuguese took jaca and handed it on to us. \"They call it,\" says Garcia Orta, \"in Malavar jacas, in Canarese and Guzerati panas\" (f. 111). \"The Tamil form is s\u0101kkei, the meaning of which, as may be adduced from various uses to which the word is put in Tamil, is 'the fruit abounding in rind and refuse.'\" (Letter from Bp. Caldwell.)\n We can hardly doubt that this is the fruit of which Pliny writes: \"Major alia pomo et suavitate praecellentior; quo sapientiores Indorum vivunt. (Folium alas avium imitatur longitudine trium cubitorum, latitudine duum). Fructum e cortice mittit admirabilem succi dulcedine; ut uno quaternos satiet. Arbori nomen palae, pomo arienae; plurima est in Sydracis, expeditionum Alexandri termino. Est et alia similis huic; dulcior pomo; sed interanecrum valetudini infesta\" (Hist. Nat. xii. 12). Thus rendered, not too faithfully, by Philemon Holland: \"Another tree there is in India, greater yet than the former; bearing a fruit much fairer, bigger, and sweeter than the figs aforesaid; and whereof the Indian Sages and Philosophers do ordinarily live. The leaf resembleth birds' wings, carrying three cubits in length, and two in breadth. The fruit it putteth forth at the bark, having within it a wonderfull pleasant juice: insomuch as one of them is sufficient to give four men a competent and full refection. The tree's name is Pala, and the fruit is called Ariena. Great plenty of them is in the country of the Sydraci, the utmcst limit of Alexander the Great his expeditions and voyages. And yet there is another tree much like to this, and beareth a fruit more delectable that this Ariena, albeit the guts in a man's belly it wringeth and breeds the bloudie flix\" (i. 361).\n Strange to say, the fruit thus described has been generally identified with the plantain: so generally that (we presume) the Linnaean name of the plantain Musa sapientum, was founded upon the interpretation of this passage. (It was, I find, the excellent Rumphius who originated the erroneous identification of the ariena with the plantain). Lassen, at first hesitatingly (i. 262), and then more positively (ii. 678), adopts this interpretation, and seeks ariena in the Skt. v\u0101ra\u1e47a. The shrewder Gildemeister does the like, for he, sans phrase, uses arienae as Latin for 'plantains.' Ritter, too, accepts it, and is not staggered even by the uno quaternos satiet. Humboldt, quoth he, often saw Indians make their meal with a very little manioc and three bananas of the big kind (Platano-arton). Still less sufficed the Indian Brahmins (sapientes), when one fruit was enough for four of them (v. 876, 877). Bless the venerable Prince of Geographers! Would one Kartoffel, even \"of the big kind,\" make a dinner for four German Professors? Just as little would one plantain suffice four Indian Sages.\n The words which we have italicised in the passage from Pliny are quite enough to show that the jack is intended; the fruit growing e cortice (i.e. piercing the bark of the stem, not pendent from twigs like other fruit), the sweetness, the monstrous size, are in combination infallible. And as regards its being the fruit of the sages, we may observe that the jack fruit is at this day in Travancore one of the staples of life. But that Pliny, after his manner, has jumbled things, is also manifest. The first two clauses of his description (Major alia, &c.; Folium alas, &c.) are found in Theophrastus, but apply to two different trees. Hence we get rid of the puzzle about the big leaves, which led scholars astray after plantains, and originated Musa sapientum. And it is clear from Theophrastus that the fruit which caused dysentery in the Macedonian army was yet another. So Pliny has rolled three plants into one. Here are the passages of Theophrastus:-\n \"(1) And there is another tree which is both itself a tree of great size, and produces a fruit that is wonderfully big and sweet. This is used for food by the Indian Sages, who wear no clothes. (2) And there is yet another which has the leaf of a very long shape, and resembling the wings of birds, and this they set upon helmets; the length is about two cubits. . . . (3) There is another tree the fruit of which is long, and not straight but crooked, and sweet to the taste. But this gives rise to colic and dysentery (\"*)/ALLO TE/ E)STIN OU)= O( KARPO\\S MAKRO\\S KAI\\ OU)/K EU)QU\\S A)LLA\\ SKOLIO\\S, E)SQIO/ MENOS DE\\ GLUKU/S. *OU(=TOS E)N TH=| KOILI/A| DHGMO\\N POIEI= KAI\\ DUSENTE/RIAN . . .\") wherefore Alexander published a general order against eating it.\" -- (Hist. Plant. iv. 4-5).\n It is plain that Pliny and Theophrastus were using the same authority, but neither copying the whole of what he found in it.\n The second tree, whose leaves were like birds' wings and were used to fix upon helmets, is hard to identify. The first was, when we combine the additional characters quoted by Pliny but omitted by Theophrastus, certainly the jack; the third was, we suspect, the mango (q.v.). The terms long and crocked would, perhaps, answer better to the plantain, but hardly the unwholesome effect. As regards the uno quaternos satiet, compare Friar Jordanus below, on the jack: \"Sufficiet circiter pro quinque personis.\" Indeed the whole of the Friar's account is worth comparing with Pliny's. Pliny says that it took four men to eat a jack, Jordanus says five. But an Englishman who had a plantation in Central Java told one of the present writers that he once cut a jack on his ground which took three men -- not to eatbut to carry!\n As regards the names given by Pliny it is hard to say anything to the purpose, because we do not know to which of the three trees jumbled together the names really applied. If pala really applied to the jack, possibly it may be the Skt. phalasa, or panasa. Or it may be merely p'hala, 'a fruit,' and the passage would then be a comical illustration of the persistence of Indian habits of mind. For a stranger in India, on asking the question, 'What on earth is that?' as he well might on his first sight of a jack-tree with its fruit, would at the present day almost certainly receive for answer: 'Phal hai khud\u0101wand!' 'It is a fruit, my lord!' Ariena looks like hira\u1e47ya, 'golden,' which might be an epithet of the jack, but we find no such specific application of the word.\n Omitting Theophrastus and Pliny, the oldest foreign description of the jack that we find is that by Hwen T'sang, who met with it in Bengal:\n c. A.D. 650. -- \"Although the fruit of the pan-wa-so (panasa) is gathered in great quantities, it is held in high esteem. These fruits are as big as a pumpkin; when ripe they are of a reddish yellow. Split in two they disclose inside a quantity of little fruits as big as crane's eggs; and when these are broken there exudes a juice of reddish-yellow colour and delicious flavour. Sometimes the fruit hangs on the branches, as with other trees; but sometimes it grows from the roots, like the fo-ling (Radix Chinae), which is found under the ground.\" -- Julien, iii. 75.\n c. 1328. -- \"There are some trees that bear a very big fruit called chaqui; and the fruit is of such size that one is enough for about five persons. There is another tree that has a fruit like that just named, and it is called Bloqui [a corruption of Malay\u0101l. varikka, 'superior fruit'], quite as big and as sweet, but not of the same species. These fruits never grow upon the twigs, for these are not able to bear their weight, but only from the main branches, and even from the trunk of the tree itself, down to the very roots.\"- Friar Jordanus, 13-14.\n A unique MS. of the travels of Friar Odoric, in the Palatine Library at Florence, contains the following curious passage:-\n c. 1330. -- \"And there be also trees which produce fruits so big that two will be a load for a strong man. And when they are eaten you must oil your hands and your mouth; they are of a fragrant odour and very savoury; the fruit is called chabassi.\" The name is probably corrupt (perhaps chacassi?). But the passage about oiling the hands and lips is aptly elucidated by the description in Baber's Memoirs (see below), a description matchless in its way, and which falls off sadly in the new translation by M. Pavet de Courteille, which quite omits the \"haggises.\"\n c. 1335. -- \"The Shak\u012b and Bark\u012b. This name is given to certain trees which live to a great age. Their leaves are like those of the walnut, and the fruit grows direct out of the stem of the tree. The fruits borne nearest to the ground are the bark\u012b; they are sweeter and better-flavoured than the Shak\u012b . . .\" etc. (much to the same effect as before). -- Ibn Batuta, iii. 127; see also iv. 228.\n c. 1350. -- \"There is again another wonderful tree called Chake-Baruke, as big as an oak. Its fruit is produced from the trunk, and not from the branches, and is something marvellous to see, being as big as a great lamb, or a child of three years old. It has a hard rind like that of our pine-cones, so that you have to cut it open with a hatchet; inside it has a pulp of surpassing flavour, with the sweetness of honey, and of the best Italian melon; and this also contains some 500 chestnuts of like flavour, which are capital eating when roasted.\" -- John de' Marignolli, in Cathay, &c., 363.\n c. 1440. -- \"There is a tree commonly found, the trunk of which bears a fruit resembling a pine-cone, but so big that a man can hardly lift it; the rind is green and hard, but still yields to the pressure of the finger. Inside there are some 250 or 300 pippins, as big as figs, very sweet in taste, and contained in separate membranes. These have each a kernel within, of a windy quality, of the consistence and taste of chestnuts, and which are roasted like chestnuts. And when cast among embers (to roast), unless you make a cut in them they will explode and jump out. The outer rind of the fruit is given to cattle. Sometimes the fruit is also found growing from the roots of the tree underground, and these fruits excel the others in flavour, wherefore they are sent as presents to kings and petty princes. These (moreover) have no kernels inside them. The tree itself resembles a large fig-tree, and the leaves are cut into fingers like the hand. The wood resembles box, and so it is esteemed for many uses. The name of the tree is Cachi\" (i.e. \u00c7achi or Tzacchi). -- Nicolo de' Conti.\n The description of the leaves . . . \"foliis da modum palmi intercisis\" -- is the only slip in this admirable description. Conti must, in memory, have confounded the Jack with its congener the bread-fruit (Artocarpus incisa or incisifolia). We have translated from Poggio's Latin, as the version by Mr. Winter Jones in India in the XVth Century is far from accurate.\n 1530. -- \"Another is the kadhil. This has a very bad look and flavour (odour ?). It looks like a sheep's stomach stuffed and made into a haggis. It has a sweet sickly taste. Within it are stones like a filbert. . . . The fruit is very adhesive, and on account of this adhesive quality many rub their mouths with oil before eating them. They grow not only from the branches and trunk, but from its root. You would say that the tree was all hung round with haggises!\" -- Leyden and Erskine's Baber, 325. Here kadhil represents the Hind. name ka\u1e6dhal. The practice of oiling the lips on account of the \"adhesive quality\" (or as modern mortals would call it, 'stickiness') of the jack, is still usual among natives, and is the cause of a proverb on premature precautions: G\u0101ch'h mein Ka\u1e6dhal, hon\u1e6dh men tel! \"You have oiled your lips while the jack still hangs on the tree!\" We may observe that the call of the Indian cuckoo is in some of the Gangetic districts rendered by the natives as Ka\u1e6dhal pakk\u0101! Ka\u1e6dhal pakk\u0101! i.e. \"Jack's ripe,\" the bird appearing at that season.\n [1547. -- \"I consider it right to make over to them in perpetuity . . . one palm grove and an area for planting certain mango trees and jack trees (mangueiras e jaqueiras) situate in the village of Calangute. . . .\" -- Archiv.

Robinson, In My Indian Garden, 49-50.\n It will be observed that the older authorities mention two varieties of the fruit by the names of shak\u012b and bark\u012b, or modifications of these, different kinds according to Jordanus, only from different parts of the tree according to Ibn Batuta. P. Vincenzo Maria (1672) also distinguishes two kinds, one of which he calls Giacha Barca, the other Giacha papa or girasole. And Rheede, the great authority on Malabar plants, says (iii. 19):\n \"Of this tree, however, they reckon more than 30 varieties, distinguished by the quality of their fruit, but all may be reduced to two kinds; the fruit of one kind distinguished by plump and succulent pulp of delicious honey flavour, being the varaka; that of the other, filled with softer and more flabby pulp of inferior flavour, being the Tsjakapa.\"\n More modern writers seem to have less perception in such matters than the old travellers, who entered more fully and sympathetically into native tastes. Drury says, however, \"There are several varieties, but what is called the Honey-jack is by far the sweetest and best.\"\n \"He that desireth to see more hereof let him reade Ludovicus Romanus, in his fifth Booke and fifteene Chapter of his Navigaciouns, and Christopherus a Costa in his cap. of Iaca, and Gracia ab Horto, in the Second Booke and fourth Chapter,\" saith the learned Paludanus . . . And if there be anybody so unreasonable, so say we too -- by all means let him do so! [A part of this article is derived from the notes to Jordanus by one of the present writers. We may also add, in aid of such further investigation, that Paludanus is the Latinised name of v.d. Broecke, the commentator on Linschoten. \"Ludovicus Romanus\" is our old friend Varthema, and \"Gracia ab Horto\" is Garcia De Orta.]\n", "jackal": "s.

The common Hind. word is g\u012bdar, ['the greedy one,' Skt. g\u1e5bidh].

This is a trade name, and is a capital specimen of Hobson-Jobson. It is, according to Sir R. Burton, [Zanzibar, i. 357], a corruption of chak\u0101zi. There are three qualities of copal in the Zanzibar market. 1. Sandarusi m'ti, or 'Tree Copal,' gathered directly from the tree which exudes it (Trachylobium Mossambicense). 2. Chak\u0101zi or chakazzi, dug from the soil, but seeming of recent origin, and priced on a par with No. 1. 3. The genuine Sandarusi, or true Copal (the Anim\u00e9 of the English market), which is also fossil, but of ancient production, and bears more than twice the price of 1 and 2 (see Sir J. Kirk in J. Linn. Soc. (Botany) for 1871). Of the meaning of chak\u0101zi we have no authentic information. But consider ing that a pitch made of copal and oil is used in Kutch, and that the cheaper copal would naturally be used for such a purpose, we may suggest as probable that the word is a corr. of jah\u0101zi, and ='ship-copal.'\n", "jacquete": "Town and Cape, n.p.

The well-known mineral, so much prized in China, and so wonderfully wrought in that and other Asiatic countries; the yashm of the Persians; nephrite of mineralogists. \n The derivation of the word has been the subject of a good deal of controversy.

On bej\u0101dah his note runs: \"The name of a gem, by some said to be a species of ruby, and by others a species of sapphire; but jade is no doubt meant.\" This interpretation seems however chiefly, if not altogether, suggested by the name; whilst the epithets compounded of bej\u0101da, as given in dictionaries, suggest a red mineral, which jade rarely is. And Prof. Max M\u00fcller, in an interesting letter to the Times, dated Jan. 10, 1880, states that the name jade was not known in Europe till after the discovery of America, and that the jade brought from America was called by the Spaniards piedra de ijada, because it was supposed to cure pain in the groin (Sp. ijada); for like reasons to which it was called lapis nephriticus, whence nephrite (see Bailey, below).

Prof. Cowell finds yed\u00e1 a material out of which ornaments are made, in the Divy\u00e1vad\u00e1na; but it does not seem to be Sanskrit.\" Prof. M\u00fcller's etymology seems incontrovertible; but the present work has afforded various examples of curious etymological coincidences of this kind.

But the palmyra, the caryota, and the cocopalm all give it; the first as the staple of Tinnevelly and northern Ceylon; the second chiefly in southern Ceylon, where it is known to Europeans as the Jaggery Palm (kit\u016bl of natives); the third is much drawn for toddy (q.v.) in the coast districts of Western India, and this is occasionally boiled for sugar. Jaggery is usually made in the form of small round cakes. Great quantities are produced in Tinnevelly, where the cakes used to pass as a kind of currency (as cakes of salt used to pass in parts of Africa, and in Western China), and do even yet to some small extent. In Bombay all rough unrefined sugar-stuff is known by this name; and it is the title under which all kinds of halfprepared sugar is classified in the tariff of the Railways there.

The non-Brahmanical sect so called; believed to represent the earliest heretics of Buddhism, at present chiefly to be found in the Bombay Presidency. There are a few in Mysore, Canara, and in some parts of the Madras Presidency, but in the Middle Ages they appear to have been numerous on the coast of the Peninsula generally. They are also found in various parts of Central and Northern India and Behar. The Jains are generally merchants, and some have been men of enormous wealth (see Colebrooke's Essays, i. 378 seqq.; [Lassen, in Ind. Antiq. ii. 193 seqq., 258 seqq.]). The name is Skt. jaina, meaning a follower of jina. The latter word is a title applied to certain saints worshipped by the sect in the place of gods; it is also a name of the Buddhas. An older name for the followers of the sect appears to have been Nirgrantha, 'without bond,' properly the title of Jain ascetics only (otherwise Yatis), [and in particular of the Digambara or 'sky-clad,' naked branch].

A title borne by certain chiefs in Kutch, in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101\u1e5b, and on the lower Indus. The derivation is very obscure (see Elliot, i. 495). The title is probably Bil\u016bch originally. There are several J\u0101ms in Lower Sind and its borders, and notably the J\u0101m of Las Bela State, a well-known dependency of Kelat, bordering the sea. [Mr. Longworth Dames writes: \"I do not think the word is of Balochi origin, although it is certainly made use of in the Balochi language. It is rather Sindhi, in the broad sense of the word, using Sindhi as the natives do, referring to the tribes of the Indus valley without regard to the modern boundaries of the province of Sindh. As far as I know, it is used as a title, not by Baloches, but by indigenous tribes of R\u0101jput or Jat origin, now, of course, all Musulmans. The J\u0101m of Las Bela belongs to a tribe of this nature known as the J\u0101mhat. In the Dera Gh\u0101z\u012b Kh\u0101n District it is used by certain local notables of this class, none of them Baloches. The principal tribe there using it is the Udh\u0101na.

It is repeatedly used in the Mohit of Sidi'Ali, published in the J. As. Soc. Bengal. It would appear from J. Prinsep's remarks there that the word is used in various ways. Thus Baron J. Hammer writes to Prinsep: \"Concerning the measure of azw\u0101m the first section of the IIId. chapter explains as follows: 'The z\u0101m is either the practical one ('arf\u012b), or the rhetorical (i\u1e63\u1e6dil\u0101\u1e25\u012b -- but this the acute Prinsep suggests should be a\u1e63\u1e6darl\u0101b\u012b, 'pertaining to the divisions of the astrolabe'). The practical is one of the 8 parts into which day and night are divided; the rhetorical (but read the astrolabic) is the 8th part of an inch (i\u1e63\u0101ba) in the ascension and descension of the stars; . . . an explanation which helps me not a bit to understand the true measure of a z\u0101m, in the reckoning of a ship's course.\" Prinsep then elucidates this: The z\u0101m in practical parlance is said to be the 8th part of day and night; it is in fact a nautical watch or Hindu pahar (see PUHUR). Again, it is the 8th part of the ordinary inch, like the jau or barleycorn of the Hindus (the 8th part of an angul or digit), of which jau, z\u0101m is possibly a corruption. Again, the i\u1e63\u0101ba or inch, and the z\u0101m or \u215b of an inch, had been transferred to the rude angle-instruments of the Arab navigators; and Prinsep deduces from statements in Sidi'Ali's book that the is\u0101ba' was very nearly equal to 96' and the z\u0101m to 12'. Prinsep had also found on enquiry among Arab mariners, that the term z\u0101m was still well known to nautical people as \u2155 of a geographical degree, or 12 nautical miles, quite confirmatory of the former calculation; it was also stated to be still applied to terrestrial measurements (see J.A.S.B. v. 642-3).\n 1013. -- \"J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 de S\u00e9rira (read Sarbaza) qui est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extremit\u00e9 de l'\u00eele de La\u0302meri, \u00e0 cent-vingt za\u0302ma\u0302 de Kala.\" -- Aj\u0101\u012bb-al-Hind, ed.

The name of a precious stone often mentioned by writers of the 16th century, but respecting the identity of which there seems to be a little obscurity. The English Encyclopaedia, and the Times Reviewer of Emanuel's book On Precious Stones (1866), identify it with the hyacinth or jacinth; but Lord Stanley of Alderley, in his translation of Barbosa (who mentions the stone several times under the form giagonza and jagonza), on the authority of a practical jeweller identifies it with corundum. This is probably an error. Jagonza looks like a corruption of jacinthus. And Ha\u00fcy's Mineralogy identifies jargon and hyacinth under the common name of zircon. Dana's Mineralogy states that the term hyacinth is applied to these stones, consisting of a silicate of zirconia, \"which present bright colours, considerable transparency, and smooth shining surfaces. . . . The variety from Ceylon, which is colourless, and has a smoky tinge, and is therefore sold for inferior diamonds, is sometimes called jargon\" (Syst. of Mineral., 3rd ed., 1850, 379-380; [Encycl. Britt. 9th ed. xxiv. 789 seq.]).\n The word probably comes into European languages through the Span. a zarcon, a word of which there is a curious history in Dozy and Engelmann.  Two Spanish words and their distinct Arabic originals have been confounded in the Span. Dict. of Cobarruvias (1611) and others following him. Sp. zarca is 'a woman with blue eyes,' and this comes from Ar. zar\u1e33\u0101, fem. of azra\u1e33, 'blue.' This has led the lexicographers above referred to astray, and azarcon has been by them defined as a 'blue earth, made of burnt lead.' But azarcon really applies to 'red-lead,' or vermilion, as does the Port. zarca\u0303o, azarca\u0303o, and its proper sense is as the Dict. of the Sp. Academy says (after repeating the inconsistent explanation and etymology of Cobarruvias), \"an intense orange-colour, Lat. color aureus.\" This is from the Ar. zar\u1e33\u016bn, which in Ibn Baithar is explained as synonymous with sal\u012b\u1e33\u016bn, and asranj, \"which the Greeks call sandix,\" i.e. cinnabar or vermilion (see Sontheimer's Ebn Beithar, i. 44, 530). And the word, as Dozy shows, occurs in Pliny under the form syricum (see quotations below). The eventual etymology is almost certainly Persian, either zarg\u016bn, 'gold colour,' as Marcel Devic suggests, or \u0101zarg\u016bn (perhaps more properly \u0101\u1e93arg\u016bn, from \u0101\u1e93ar, 'fire'), 'flame-colour,' as Dozy thinks.\n A.D. c. 70. -- \"Hoc ergo adulteratur minium in officinis sociorum, et ubivis Syrico.

His *)IABADI/OU represents with singular correctness what was probably the Prakrit or popular form of Yavadv\u012bpa (see under DIU and MALDIVES), and his interpretation of the Sanskrit is perfectly correct. It will still remain a question whether Yava was not applied to some cereal more congenial to the latitude than barley,* or was (as is possible) an attempt to give an Indian meaning to some aboriginal name of similar sound. But the sixth of our quotations, the transcript and translation of a Sanskrit inscription in the Museum at Batavia by Mr. Holle, which we owe to the kindness of Prof. Kern, indicates that a signification of wealth in cereals was attached to the name in the early days of its Indian civilization. This inscription is most interesting, as it is the oldest dated inscription yet discovered upon Javanese soil. Till a recent time it was not known that there was any mention of Java in Sanskrit literature, and this was so when Lassen published the 2nd vol. of his Indian Antiquities (1849). But in fact Java was mentioned in the R\u0101m\u0101yana, though a perverted reading disguised the fact until the publication of the Bombay edition in 1863. The The Teutonic word Corn affords a handy instance of the varying application of the name of a cereal to that which is, or has been, the staple grain of each country. Corn in England familiarly means 'wheat'; in Scotland 'oats'; in Germany 'rye'; in America 'maize.'\n passage is given in our second quotation; and we also give passages from two later astronomical works whose date is approximately known. The Yava - Ko\u1e6di, or Java Point of these writers is understood by Prof. Kern to be the eastern extremity of the island.\n We have already (see BENJAMIN) alluded to the fact that the terms J\u0101wa, J\u0101wi were applied by the Arabs to the Archipelago generally, and often with specific reference to Sumatra. Prof. Kern, in a paper to which we are largely indebted, has indicated that this larger application of the term was originally Indian. He has discussed it in connection with the terms \"Golden and Silver Islands\" (Suvar\u1e47a dv\u012bpa and R\u016bpya dv\u012bpa), which occur in the quotation from the R\u0101m\u0101yana, and elsewhere in Sanskrit literature, and which evidently were the basis of the Chryse and Argyr\u0113, which take various forms in the writings of the Greek and Roman geographers. We cannot give the details of his discussion, but his condensed conclusions are as follows:- (1.) Suvar\u1e47a - dv\u012bpa and Yava - dv\u012bpa were according to the prevalent representations the same; (2.) Two names of islands originally distinct were confounded with one another; (3.) Suvar\u1e47a-dv\u012bpa in its proper meaning is Sumatra, Yava-dv\u012bpa in its proper meaning is Java; (4.) Sumatra, or a part of it, and Java were regarded as one whole, doubtless because they were politically united; (5.) By Yava-ko\u1e6di was indicated the east point of Java.\n This Indian (and also insular) identification, in whole or in part, of Sumatra with Java explains a variety of puzzles, e.g. not merely the Arab application of Java, but also the ascription, in so many passages, of great wealth of gold to Java, though the island, to which that name properly belongs, produces no gold. This tradition of gold-produce we find in the passages quoted from Ptolemy, from the R\u0101m\u0101yana, from the Holle inscription, and from Marco Polo. It becomes quite intelligible when we are taught that Java and Sumatra were at one time both embraced under the former name, for Sumatra has always been famous for its gold - production.

And so almost all English maps persist in representing it, though this eastern channel is now, unless in the rainy season, shallow and insignificant; the vast body of the Burrampooter cutting across the neck of the peninsula under the name of Jenai, and uniting with the Ganges near Pubna (about 150 miles N.E. of Calcutta), from which point the two rivers under the name of Pudda (Padda) flow on in mighty union to the sea.\" (Blackwood's Mag., March 1852, p. 338.)\n The river is indicated as an offshoot of the Burrampooter in Rennell's Bengal Atlas (Map No. 6) under the name of Jenni, but it is not mentioned in his Memoir of the Map of Hindostan.

Wilkinson has: \"jempana, Skt.? a kind of State carriage or sedan for ladies of the court.\"] The word cannot, however, have been introduced into India by the officers who served in Java (1811-15), for its use is much older in the Him\u0101laya, as may be seen from the quotation from P.

Jagann\u0101tha, 'Lord of the Universe,' a name of Krishna worshipped as Vishnu at the famous shrine of P\u016br\u012b in Orissa. The image so called is an amorphous idol, much like those worshipped in some of the South Sea Islands, and it has been plausibly suggested (we believe first by Gen. Cunningham) that it was in reality a Buddhist symbol, which has been adopted as an object of Brahmanical worship, and made to serve as the image of a god. The idol was, and is, annually dragged forth in procession on a monstrous car, and as masses of excited pilgrims crowded round to drag or accompany it, accidents occurred. Occasionally also persons, sometimes sufferers from painful disease, cast themselves before the advancing wheels. The testimony of Mr. Stirling, who was for some years Collector of Orissa in the second decade of the last century, and that of Sir W. W. Hunter, who states that he had gone through the MS. archives of the province since it became British, show that the popular impression in regard to the continued frequency of immolations on these occasions -- a belief that has made Juggurnaut a standing metaphor -- was greatly exaggerated. The belief indeed in the custom of such immolation had existed for centuries, and the rehearsal of these or other cognate religious suicides at one or other of the great temples of the Peninsula, founded partly on fact, and partly on popular report, finds a place in almost every old narrative relating to India. The really great mortality from hardship, exhaustion, and epidemic disease which frequently ravaged the crowds of pilgrims on such occasions, doubtless aided in keeping up the popular impressions in connection with the Juggurnaut festival.\n [1311. -- \"Jagn\u00e1r.\" See under MADURA.]\n c. 1321. -- \"Annually on the recurrence of the day when that idol was made, the folk of the country come and take it down, and put it on a fine chariot; and then the King and Queen, and the whole body of the people, join together and draw it forth from the church with loud singing of songs, and all kinds of music . . . and many pilgrims who have come to this feast cast themselves under the chariot, so that its wheels may go over them, saying that they desire to die for their god. And the car passes over them, and crushes them, and cuts them in sunder, and so they perish on the spot.\" -- Friar Odoric, in Cathay, &c. i. 83.\n c. 1430. -- \"In Bizenegalia (see BIS- NAGAR) also, at a certain time of the year, this idol is carried through the city, placed between two chariots . . . accompanied by a great concourse of people. Many, carried away by the fervour of their faith, cast themselves on the ground before the wheels, in order that they may be crushed to death, -- a mode of death which they say is very acceptable to their god.\" -- N. Conti, in India in X Vth Cent., 28.\n c. 1581. -- \"All for devotion attach themselves to the trace of the car, which is drawn in this manner by a vast number of people . . . and on the annual feast day of the Pagod this car is dragged by crowds of people through certain parts of the city (Negapatam), some of whom from devotion, or the desire to be thought to make a devoted end, cast themselves down under the wheels of the cars, and so perish, remaining all ground and crushed by the said cars.\" -- Gasparo Balbi, f. 84. The preceding passages refer to scenes in the south of the Peninsula.\n c. 1590. -- \"In the town of Pursotem on the banks of the sea stands the temple of Jagnaut, near to which are the images of Kishen, his brother, and their sister, made of Sandal-wood, which are said to be 4,000 years old. . . .

The term occurs repeatedly in Mr. Egerton's catalogue of arms in the India Museum. Janbwa occurs as the name of a dagger in the \u0100\u012bn (orig. i. 119); why Blochmann in his translation [i. 110] spells it jhanbwah we do not know. See also Dozy and Eng. s.v. jambette.

[A drawing of what he calls a jamdhar kat\u0101r\u012b is given in Egerton's Catalogue (Pl. IX. No. 344-5).] F. Johnson's Dictionary gives jamdar as a Persian word with the suggested etymology of janb-dar, 'flankrender.' But in the \u0100\u012bn the word is spelt jamdhar, which seems to indicate Hind. origin; and its occurrence in the poem of Chand Bard\u0101i (see Ind. Antiq. i. 281) corroborates this. Mr. Beames there suggests the etymology of Yama-dant 'Death's Tooth.' The drawings of the jamdhad or jamdhar in the \u0100\u012bn illustrations show several specimens with double and triple toothed points, which perhaps favours this view; but Yama-dh\u0101ra, 'deathwielder,' appears in the Sanskrit dictionaries as the name of a weapon.

The State is also called Habs\u0101n, meaning 'Hubshee's land,' from the fact that for 3 or 4 centuries its chief has been of that race. This was not at first continuous, nor have the chiefs, even when of African blood, been always of one family; but they have apparently been so for the last 200 years.

Drummond, Illns. (s.v.).\n", "junk": "s. A large Eastern ship; especially (and in later use exclusively) a Chinese ship. This indeed is the earliest application also; any more general application belongs to an intermediate period. This is one of the oldest words in the Europeo-Indian vocabulary. It occurs in the travels of Friar Odorico, written down in 1331, and a few years later in the rambling reminscences of John de' Marignolli. The great Catalan Worldmap of 1375 gives a sketch of one of those ships with their sails of bamboo matting and calls them Xnchi. no doubt a clerical error for Xu\u0303chi. Dobner, the original editor of Marignolli, in the 18th century, says of the word (junkos): \"This word I cannot find in any medieval glossary. Most probably we are to understand vessels of platted reeds (a juncis texta) which several authors relate to be used in India.\" It is notable that the same erroneous suggestion is made by Amerigo Vespucci in his curious letter to one of the Medici, giving an account of the voyage of Da Gama, whose squadron he had met at C. Verde on its way home.\n The French translators of Ibn Batuta derive the word from the Chinese tchouen (chwen), and Littr\u00e9 gives the same etymology (s.v. jonque). It is possible that the word may be eventually traced to a Chinese original, but not very probable. The old Arab traders must have learned the word from Malay pilots, for it is certainly the Javanese and Malay jong and ajong, 'a ship or large vessel.' In Javanese the Great Bear is called Lintang jong, 'The Constellation Junk,' [which is in Malay Bintang Jong. The various forms in Malay and cognate languages, with the Chinese words which have been suggested as the origin, are very fully given by Scott, Malayan Words in English, p. 59 seq.].\n c. 1300. -- \"Large ships called in the language of China 'Junks' bring various sorts of choice merchandize and cloths from Ch\u00edn and M\u00e1ch\u00edn, and the countries of Hind and Sind.\" -- Rash\u00eddudd\u00edn, in Elliot, i. 69.\n 1331. -- \"And when we were there in harbour at Polumbum, we embarked in another ship called a Junk (aliam navim nomine Zuncum). . . .

Each of these big ships carries from three up to twelve sails. The sails are made of bamboo slips, woven like mats; they are never hauled down, but are shifted round as the wind blows from one quarter or another.\" -- Ibn Batuta, iv. 91. The French translators write the words as gonk (and gono\u00fbk). Ibn Batuta really indicates chunk (and chun\u016bk); but both must have been quite wrong.\n c. 1348. -- \"Wishing them to visit the shrine of St. Thomas the Apostle . . . we embarked on certain Junks (ascendentes Junkos) from Lower India, which is called Minubar.\" -- Marignolli, in Cathay, &c., 356.\n 1459. -- \"About the year of Our Lord 1420, a Ship or Junk of India, in crossing the Indian Sea, was driven . . . in a westerly and south-westerly direction for 40 days, without seeing anything but sky and sea. . . .

The name is, according to Crawfurd (Malay Dict. S.V. Salang, and Dict. Ind. Archip. S.V. Ujung) Ujung Salang, 'Salang Headland.' [Mr. Skeat doubts the correctness of this. \"There is at least one quite possible alternative, i.e. jong salang, in which jong means 'a junk,' and salang, when applied to vessels, 'heavily tossing' (see Klinkert, Dict. s.v. salang). Another meaning of salang is 'to transfix a person with a dagger,' and is the technical term for Malay executions, in which the kris was driven down from the collar-bone to the heart.

Jute, a fibrous substance, he explained from the Sanskrit j\u016b\u1e6da, a less usual form of jata, meaning, 1st, the matted hair of an ascetic; 2ndly, the fibrous roots of a tree such as the banyan; 3rdly, any fibrous substance\" (Academy, Dec. 27, 1879). The secondary meanings attributed here to ja\u1e6da are very doubtful.* The term jute appears to have been first used by Dr. Roxburgh in a letter dated 1795, in which he drew the attention of the Court of Directors to the value of the fibre \"called jute by the natives.\" [It appears, however, as early as 1746 in the Log of a voyage quoted by Col. Temple in J.R.A.S., Jan. 1900, p. 158.] The name in fact appears to be taken from the vernacular name in Orissa.
