{"xerafine": "&c., s. The word in this form represents a silver coin formerly current at Goa and several other Eastern ports, in value somewhat less than 1s. 6d. It varied in Portuguese currency from 300 to 360 reis. But in this case as in so many others the term is a corruption applied to a degenerated value. The original is the Arabic ashraf\u012b (see ASHRAFEE) (or shar\u012bf\u012b, 'noble' -- compare the medieval coin so called), which was applied properly to the gold d\u012bn\u0101r, but was also in India, and still is occasionally by natives, applied to the gold mohur. Ashraf\u012b for a gold d\u012bn\u0101r (value in gold about 11s. 6d.) occurs frequently in the '1001 Nights,' as Dozy states, and he gives various other quotations of the word in different forms (pp. 353-354; [Burton, Ar. Nights, x. 160, 376]). Aigrefin, the name of a coin once known in France, is according to Littr\u00e9 also a corruption of ashraf\u012b.\n 1498. -- \"And (the King of Calicut) said that they should tell the Captain that if he wished to go he must give him 600 xarifes, and that soon, and that this was the custom of that country, and of those who came thither.\" -- Roteiro de V. da G. 79.\n 1510. -- \"When a new Sultan succeeds to the throne, one of his lords, who are called Amirra (Ameer), says to him: 'Lord, I have been for so long a time your slave, give me Damascus, and I will give you 100,000 or 200,000 teraphim of gold.'\"- Varthema, 10.\n \" \"Every Mameluke, great or little, has for his pay six sar\u00e1phi per month.\"- Ibid. 13.\n \" \"Our captain sent for the superior of the said mosque, to whom he said: that he should show him the body of Nabi- this Nabi means the Prophet Mahomet -- that he would give him 3000 seraphim of gold.\" -- lbid. 29.

This is the gold mohur.\n 1540. -- \"This year there was such a famine in Choromandel, that it left nearly the whole land depopulated with the mor tality, and people ate their fellow men. Such a thing never was heard of on that Coast, where formerly there was such an abundance of rice, that in the port of Negapatam I have often seen more than 700 sail take cargoes amounting to more than 20,000 moios (the moyo = 29.39 bushels) of rice. . . . This year of famine the Portuguese of the town of St. Thom\u00e9 did much good to the people, helping them with quantities of rice and millet, and coco-nuts and jagra (see JAGGERY), which they imported in their vessels from other parts, and sold in retail to the people at far lower prices than they could have got if they wished it; and some rich people caused quantities of rice to be boiled in their houses, and gave it boiled down in the water to the people to drink, all for the love of God. . . . This famine lasted a whole year, and it spread to other parts, but was not so bad as in Choromandel. The King of Bisnagar, who was sovereign of that territory, heard of the humanity and beneficence of the Portuguese to the people of the country, and he was greatly pleased thereat, and sent an ola (see OLLAH) of thanks to the residents of S. Thom\u00e9. And this same year there was such a scarcity of provisions in the harbours of the Straits, that in Aden a load (fardo) of rice fetched forty xarafis, each worth a cruzado. . . .\"- Correa, iv. 131-132.\n 1598. -- \"The chief and most common money (at Goa) is called Pardauue (Pardao) Xeraphin.

Here the gold mohur is meant.\n", "xercansor": "n.p. This is a curious example of the manner in which the Portuguese historians represent Mahommedan names. Xercansor does really very fairly represent phonetically the name of Sher Kh\u0101n S\u016br, the famous rival and displacer of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, under the title of Sher Sh\u0101h.\n c. 1538. -- \"But the King of Bengal, seeing himself very powerful in the kingdom of the Patans, seized the king and took his kingdom from him . . . and made Governor of the kingdom a great lord, a vassal of his, called Cotoxa, and then leaving everything in good order, returned to Bengal. The administrator Cotoxa took the field with a great array, having with him a Patan Captain called Xercansor, a valiant cavalier, much esteemed by all.\" -- Correa, ii. 719.\n The kingdom of the Patans appears to be Behar, where various Afghan chiefs tried to establish themselves after the conquest of Delhi by Baber. It would take more search than it is worth to elucidate the story as told by Correa, but see Elliot, iv. 333. Cotoxa (Koto sha) appears to be Kutb Kh\u0101n of the Mahommedan historian there.\n Another curious example of Portuguese nomenclature is that given to the first Mahommedan king of Malacca by Barros, Xaquem Darx\u00e1 (II. vi. 1), by Alboquerque Xaquendarxa (Comm. Pt. III. ch. 17). This name is rendered by Lassen's ponderous lore into Skt. Sakanadhara, \"d. h. Besitzer kr\u00e4ftiger Besinnungen\" (or \"Possessor, of strong recollections.\" -- Ind. Alt. iv. 546), whereas it is simply the Portuguese way of writing Sikandar Sh\u0101h! [So Linschoten (Hak. Soc. ii. 183) writes Xatamas for Sh\u0101h Tamasp.].
