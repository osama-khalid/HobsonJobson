From this use it became a title of rank without necessarily having any office attached. It is now a title occasionally conferred, like a peerage, on Mahommedan gentlemen of distinetion and good service, as R\u0101\u012b and R\u0101j\u0101 are upon Hindus.\n Nabob is used in two ways: (a) simply as a corruption and representative of Naw\u0101b. We get it direct from the Port. naba\u0302bo, see quotation from Bluteau below. (b) It began to be applied in the 18th century, when the transactions of Clive made the epithet familiar in England, to Anglo-Indians who returned with fortunes from the East; and Foote's play of 'The Nabob' (N\u00e1bob) (1768) aided in giving general currency to the word in this sense.\n a.-\n 1604. -- \". . . delante del Nauabo que es justicia mayor.\" -- Guerrero, Relacion, 70.\n 1615. -- \"There was as Nababo in Surat a certain Persian Mahommedan (Mouro Parsio) called Mocarre Bethia\u0303o, who had come to Goa in the time of the Viceroy Ruy Louren\u00e7o de Tavora, and who being treated with much familiarity and kindness by the Portuguese . . . came to confess that it could not but be that truth was with their Law. . . .\" -- Bocarro, p. 354.\n 1616. -- \"Catechumeni ergo parentes viros aliquot inducunt honestos et assessores Nauabi, id est, judicis supremi, cui consiliarii erant, uti et Proregi, ut libellum famosum adversus Pinnerum spargerent.\"- Jarric, Thesaurus, iii. 378.\n 1652. -- \"The Nahab\u2020 was sitting, acDozy says (2nd ed. 323) that the plural form has been adopted by mistake.

The great Chinese city on the lower course of the Yangtsekiang, which was adopted as capital of the Empire for a brief space (1368 1410) by the (native) Ming dynasty on the expulsion of the Mongol family of Chinghiz. The city, previously known as Kin-ling-fu, then got the style of Nan-king, or 'South Court.' Peking ('North Court') was however re-occupied as imperial residence by the Emperor Ching-su in 1410, and has remained such ever since Nanking is mentioned as a great city called Chilenfu (Kin-ling), whose walls had a circuit of 40 miles, by Friar Odoric (c. 1323). And the province bears the same name (Chelim) in the old notices of China translated by R. Willes in Hakluyt (ii. 546).\n It appears to be the city mentioned by Conti (c. 1430), as founded by the emperor: \"Hinc prope XV. dierum itinere (i.e. from Cambalec or Peking), alia civitas Nemptai nomine, ab imperatore condita, cujus ambitus patet triginta milliaribus, eaque est popolosissima omnium.\" This is evidently the same name that is coupled with Cambalec, in Petis de la Croix's translation of the Life of Timour (iii. 218) under the form Nemnai. The form Lankin, &c., is common in old Portuguese narratives, probably, like Liampo (q.v.), a Fuhkien form.\n c. 1520. -- \"After that follows Great China, the king of which is the greatest sovereign in the world. . . .

The name of a strange weird-looking volcanic cone, which rises, covered with forest, to a height of some 2,330 feet straight out of the deep sea, to the eastward of the Andamans. One of the present writers has observed (Marco Polo, Bk. III. ch. 13, note) that in the name of Narkandam one cannot but recognise Narak, 'Hell'; perhaps Naraka-ku\u1e47\u1e0dam, 'a pit of hell'; adding: \"Can it be that in old times, but still contemporary with Hindu navigation, this volcano was active, and that some Brahmin St. Brandon recognised in it the mouth of Hell, congenial to the Rakshasas of the adjacent group\" of the Andamans? We have recently received an interesting letter from Mr. F. R. Mallet of the Geological Survey of India, who has lately been on a survey of Narcondam and Barren Island. Mr. Mallet states that Narcondam is \"without any crater, and has certainly been extinct for many thousand years. Barren Island, on the other hand, forms a complete amphitheatre, with high precipitous encircling walls, and the volcano has been in violent eruption within the last century. The term 'pit of hell,' therefore, while quite inapplicable to Narcondam, applies most aptly to Barren Island.\" Mr. Mallet suggests that there may have been some confusion between the two islands, and that the name Narcondam may have been really applicable to Barren Island. [See the account of both islands in Ball, Jungle Life, 397 seqq.] The name Barren Island is quite modern. We are told in Purdy's Or. Navigator (350) that Barren Island was called by the Portuguese Ilha alta, a name which again would be much more apt for Narcondam, Barren Island being only some 800 feet high. Mr. Mallet mentions that in one of the charts of the E.I. Pilot or Oriental Navigator (1781) he finds \"Narcondam according to the Portuguese\" in 13\u02da 45' N. lat. and 110\u02da 35' E. long. (from Ferro) and \"Narcondam or High Island, according to the French,\" in 12\u02da 50' N. lat. and 110\u02da 55' E. long. This is valuable as showing both that there may have been some confusion between the islands, and that Ilha alta or High Island has been connected with the name of Narcondam. The real positions by our charts are of Narcondam, N. lat. 13\u02da 24', E. long. 94\u02da 12'. Barren Island, N. lat. 12\u02da 16', E. long. 93\u02da 54'.\n The difference of lat. (52 miles) agrees well with that between the Portuguese and French Narcondam, but the difference in long., though approximate in amount (18 or 20 miles), is in one case plus and in the other minus; so that the discrepancies may be due merely to error in the French reckoning. In a chart in the E.I. Pilot (1778) \"Monday or Barren Island, called also High Island\" and \"Ayconda or Narcondam,\" are marked approximately in the positions of the present Barren Island and Narcondam. Still, we believe that Mr. Mallet's suggestion is likely to be well founded. The form Ayconda is nearer that found in the following:\n 1598. -- \". . . as you put off from the Ilandes of Andeman towards the Coast . . . there lyeth onely in the middle way an Ilande which the inhabitantes call Viacondam, which is a small Iland having faire ground round about it, but very little fresh water.\" -- Linschoten, p. 328.\n The discrepancy in the position of the islands is noticed in D'Anville:\n 1753. -- \"Je n'oublierai pas Narcondam, et d'autant moins que ce que j'en trouve dans les Portugais ne repond point \u00e0 la position que nos cartes lui donnent.

Selon les cartes Fran\u00e7oises, Narcondam s'\u00e9carte environ 25 lieues marines de la t\u00eate d'Andaman; et au lieu de prendre plus du nord, cette \u00efle baisse vers le sud d'une fraction de degr\u00e9 plus ou moins consid\u00e9rable selon differ\u00e9ntes cartes.\" -- D'Anville, Eclairc., 141-142.\n I may add that I find in a French map of 1701 (Carte Marine depuis Suratte jusqu'au Detroit de Malaca, par le P\u00e8re P. P. Tachard) we have, in the (approximately) true position of Narcondam, Isle Haute, whilst an islet without name appears in the approximate position of Barren Island.\n", "nard": "s.

The name is a Portuguese corruption probably of the Arab or Malay form of the native name which the Burmese express as Naga-r\u012bt, 'Dragon's whirlpool.' The set of the tide here is very apt to carry vessels ashore, and thus the locality is famous for wrecks. It is possible, however, that the Burmese name is only an effort at interpretation, and that the locality was called in old times by some name like N\u0101gar\u0101shtra. Ibn Batuta touched at a continental coast occupied by uncivilised people having elephants, between Bengal and Sumatra, which he calls Baranag\u0101r. From the intervals given, the place must have been near Negrais, and it is just possible that the term Barra de Negrais, which frequently occurs in the old writers (e.g. see Balbi, Fitch, and Bocarro below) is a misinterpretation of the old name used by Ibn Batuta (iv. 224-228).\n 1553. -- \"Up to the Cape of Negrais, which stands in 16 degrees, and where the Kingdom of Pegu commences, the distance may be 100 leagues.\" -- Barros, I. ix. 1.\n 1583. -- \"Then the wind came from the S.W., and we made sail with our stern to the N.E., and running our course till morning we found ourselves close to the Bar of Negrais, as in their language they call the port which runs up into Pegu.\" -- Gasparo Balbi, f. 92.\n 1586. -- \"We entered the barre of Negrais, which is a braue barre,\" &c.

An account of the various attempts will be found in the Voyage of the Novara. Since 1869 they have been partially occupied by the British Government, as an appendage of the Andaman settlement. Comparing the old forms Lankha and Nakkav\u0101ram, and the nakedness constantly attributed to the people, it seems possible that the name may have had reference to this (na\u00f1g\u0101).

The name of the Mountain Peninsula at the end of the Mysore table land (originally known as Malain\u0101\u1e0du, 'Hill country'), which is the chief site of hill sanataria in the Madras Presidency. Skt. N\u012blagiri, 'Blue Mountain.' The name N\u012bla or N\u012bl\u0101dri (synonymous with N\u012blagiri) belongs to one of the mythical or semimythical ranges of the Puranic Cosmography (see Vishnu Pur\u0101na, in Wil\u1e63on's Works, by Hall, ii. 102, 111, &c.), and has been applied to several ranges of more assured locality, e.g. in Orissa as well as in S. India. The name seems to have been fancifully applied to the Ootacamund range about 1820, by some European. [The name was undoubtedly applied by natives to the range before the appearance of Europeans, as in the Kongu-de\u015ba Raj\u00e1kal, quoted by Grigg (Nilagiri Man. 363), and the name appears in a letter of Col. Mackenzie of about 1816 (Ibid. 278). Mr. T. M. Horsfall writes: \"The name is in common use among all classes of natives in S. India, but when it may have become specific I cannot say. Possibly the solution may be that the Nilgiris being the first large mountain range to become familiar to the English, that name was by them caught hold of, but not coined, and stuck to them by mere priority. It is on the face of it improbable that the Englishmen who early in the last century discovered these Hills, that is, explored and shot over them, would call them by a long Skt. name.\"]\n Probably the following quotation from Dampier refers to Orissa, as does that from Hedges:\n \"One of the English ships was called the Nellegree, the name taken from the Nellegree Hills in Bengal, as I have heard.\"- Dampier, ii. 145.\n 1683. -- \"In ye morning early I went up the Nilligree Hill, where I had a view of a most pleasant fruitfull valley.\" -- Hedges, Diary, March 2; [Hak.

The old word nippitatum was used for 'strong drink'; see Stanf. Dict.]\n", "nirv\u00e1na": "s. Skt. nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The literal meaning of this word is simply 'blown out,' like a candle. It is the technical term in the philosophy of the Buddhists for the condition to which they aspire as the crown and goal of virtue, viz. the cessation of sentient existence. On the exact meaning of the term see Childer's Pali Dictionary, s.v. nibb\u0101na, an article from which we quote a few sentences below, but which covers ten double-column pages. The word has become common in Europe along with the growing interest in Buddhism, and partly from its use by Schopenhauer. But it is often employed very inaccurately, of which an instance occurs in the quotation below from Dr. Draper. The oldest European occurrence of which we are aware is in Purchas, who had met with it in the Pali form common in Burma, &c., nibban.\n 1626. -- \"After death they (the Talapoys) beleeve three Places, one of Pleasure Scuum (perhaps sukham) like the Mahumitane Paradise; another of Torment Naxac (read Narac); the third of Annihilation which they call Niba.\" -- Purchas, Pilgrimage, 506.\n c. 1815. -- \". . . the state of Niban, which is the most perfect of all states.

Transience, Pain, and Unreality . . . these are the characters of all existence, and the only true good is exemption from these in the attainment of nirw\u0101na, whether that be, as in the view of the Brahmin or the theistic Buddhist, absorption into the supreme essence; or whether it be, as many have thought, absolute nothingness; or whether it be, as Mr. Hodgson quaintly phrases it, the ubi or the modus in which the infinitely attenuated elements of all things exist, in this last and highest state of abstraction from all particular modifications such as our senses and understandings are cognisant of.\" -- Yule, Mission to Ava, 236.\n \" \"When from between the s\u00e1l trees at Kusin\u00e1ra he passed into nirw\u00e1na, he (Buddha) ceased, as the extinguished fire ceases.\" -- Ibid. 239.\n 1869. -- \"What Bishop Bigandet and others represent as the popular view of the Nirva\u0302na, in contradistinction to that of the Buddhist divines, was, in my opinion, the conception of Buddha and his disciples. It represented the entrance of the soul into rest, a subduing of all wishes and desires, indifference to joy and pain, to good and evil, an absorption of the soul into itself, and a freedom from the circle of existences from birth to death, and from death to a new birth. This is still the meaning which educated people attach to it, whilst Nirva\u0302na suggests rather a kind of Mohammedan Paradise or of blissful Elysian fields to the minds of the larger masses.\" -- Prof. Max M\u00fcller, Lecture on Buddhistic Nihilism, in Tr\u00fcbner's Or.

The hereditary style of the reigning prince of the Hyderabad Territories; 'His Highness the Niz\u00e1m,' in English official phraseology. This in its full form, Niz\u0324\u0101mul-Mulk, was the title of A\u1e63af J\u0101h, the founder of the dynasty, a very able soldier and minister of the Court of Aurangz\u012bb, who became S\u016bbad\u0101r (see SOUBADAR) of the Deccan in 1713. The title is therefore the same that had pertained to the founder of the Ahmednagar dynasty more than two centuries earlier, which the Portuguese called that of Nizamaluco. And the circumstances originating the Hyderabad dynasty were parallel. At the death of A\u1e63af J\u0101h (in 1748) he was independent sovereign of a large territory in the Deccan, with his residence at Hyderabad, and with dominions in a general way corresponding to those still held by his descendant.\n", "nizamaluco": "n.p.

This was the title of one of the chiefs at the court of the B\u0101hmani king of the Deccan, who had been originally a Brahman and a slave. His son Ahmed set up a dynasty at Ahmednagar (A.D. 1490), which lasted for more than a century. The sovereigns of this dynasty were originally called by the Portuguese Nizamaluco. Their own title was Niz\u0324\u0101m Sh\u0101h, and this also occurs as Nizamoxa.

The original theory of administration in such Provinces was the union of authority in all departments under one district chief, and a kind of paternal despotism in the hands of that chief But by the gradual restriction of personal rule, and the multiplication of positive laws and rules of administration, and the division of duties, much the same might now be said of the difference between Regulation and Non-regulation Provinces that a witty Frenchman said of Intervention and Non-intervention: -- \"La Non-intervention est une phrase politique et technique qui veut dire enfin \u00e0-peu-pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame chose que l'Intervention.\"\n Our friend Gen.

By the bye, this word 'numbda' is said to be the origin of the word nomade, because the nomade tribes used the same material for their tents\" (!) -- Letter in Notes and Queries, 1st ser.i.342.]\n", "numerical affixes": "or DETERMINATIVES .* What is meant by these expressions can perhaps be best elucidated by an extract from the Malay Grammar of the late venerable John Crawfurd:\n \"In the enumeration of certain objects, the Malay has a peculiar idiom which, as far as I know, does not exist in any other language of the Archipelago. It is of the same nature as the word 'head,' as we use it in the tale of cattle, or 'sail' in the enumeration of ships; but in Malay it extends to many familiar objects. Alai, of which the original meaning has not been ascertained, is applied to such tenuous objects as leaves, grasses, &c.; Batang, meaning 'stem,' or 'trunk,' to trees, logs, spears, and javelins; Bantak, of which the meaning has not been ascertained, to such objects as rings; Bidang, which means 'spreading' or 'spacious,' to mats, carpets, thatch, sails, skins, and hides; Biji, 'seeds,' to corn, seeds, stones, pebbles, gems, eggs, the eyes of animals, lamps, and candlesticks,\" and so on. Crawfurd names 8 or 9 other terms, one or other of which is always used in company with the numeral, in ennumerating different classes of objects, as if, in English, idiom should compel us to say 'two stems of spears,' 'four spreads of carpets,' 'six corns of diamonds.' As a matter of fact we do speak of 20 head of cattle, 10 file of soldiers, 100 sail of ships, 20 pieces of cannon, a dozen stand of rifles. But still the practice is in none of these cases obligatory, it is technical and exceptional; insomuch that I remember, when a boy, in old Reform-Bill days, and when disturbances were expected in a provincial town, hearing it stated by a well-informed lady that a great proprietress in the neighbourhood was so alarmed that she had ordered from town a whole stand of muskets!\n To some small extent the idiom occurs also in other European languages, Other terms applied have been Numeralia, Quantitative Auxiliaries, Numeral Auxiliaries, Segregatives, &c.\n including French and German. Of French I don't remember any example now except t\u00eate (de betail), nor of German except St\u00fcck, which is, however, almost as universal as the Chinese piecey. A quaint example dwells in my memory of a German courier, who, when asked whether he had any employer at the moment, replied: 'Ja freilich! dreizehn St\u00fcck Amerikaner!'\n The same peculiar idiom that has been described in the extract from Crawfurd as existing in Malay, is found also in Burmese. The Burmese affixes seem to be more numerous, and their classification to be somewhat more arbitrary and sophisticated. Thus oos, a root implying 'chief' or 'first,' is applied to kings, divinities, priests, &c.; Yauk, 'a male,' to rational beings not divine; Gaung, 'a brute beast,' to irrational beings; Pya implying superficial extent, to dollars, countries, dishes, blankets, &c.; Lun, implying rotundity, to eggs, loaves, bottles, cups, toes, fingers, candles, bamboos, hands, feet, &c.; Tseng and Gyaung, 'extension in a straight line,' to rods, lines, spears, roads, &c.\n The same idiom exists in Siamese, and traces of it appear in some of the vocabularies that have been collected of tribes on the frontier of China and Tibet, indicated by the fact that the numerals in such vocabularies in various instances show identity of origin in the essential part of the numeral, whilst a different aspect is given to the whole word by a variation in what appears to be the numeralaffix* (or what Mr. Brian Hodgson calls the 'servile affix'). The idiom exists in the principal vernaculars of China itself, and it is a transfer of this idiom from Chinese dialects to Pigeon-English which has produced the piecey, which in that quaint jargon seems to be used as the universal numerical affix (\"Two piecey cooly,\" \"three piecey dollar,\" &c.).\n This one pigeon phrase represents scores that are used in the vernaculars. For in some languages the system has taken what seems an extravagant development, which must form a great difficulty in the acquisition of See Sir H. Yule's Introductory Essay to Capt. Gill's River of Golden Sand, ed. 1883, pp. [127], [128].\n colloquial use by foreigners. Some approximate statistics on this subject will be given below.\n The idiom is found in Japanese and Corean, but it is in these cases possibly not indigenous, but an adoption from the Chinese.\n It is found in several languages of C. America, i.e. the Quich\u00e9 of Guatemala, the Nahault of Mexico Proper; and in at least two other languages (Tep and Pirinda) of the same region. The following are given as the coefficients or determinatives chiefly used in the (Nahualt or) Mexican. Compare them with the examples of Malay and Burmese usage already given:\n Tetl (a stone) used for roundish or cylindrical objects; e.g. eggs, beans, cacao beans, cherries, prickly-pears, Spanish loaves, &c., also for books, and fowls:\n Pantli (?) for long rows of persons and things; also for walls and furrows:\n Tlamantli (from mana, to spread on the ground), for shoes, dishes, basins, paper, &c., also for speeches and sermons:\n Olotl (maize-grains) for ears of maize, cacao-pods, bananas: also for flint arrow-heads (see W. v. Humboldt, Kawi-Sprache, ii. 265).\n I have, by the kind aid of my friend Professor Terrien de la Couperie, compiled a list of nearly fifty languages in which this curious idiom exists. But it takes up too much space to be inserted here. I may, however, give his statistics of the number of such determinatives, as assigned in the grammars of some of these languages In Chinese vernaculars, from 33 in the Shanghai vernacular to 110 in that of Fuchau. In Corean, 12; in Japanese, 16; in Annamite, 106; in Siamese, 24; in Shan, 42; in Burmese, 40; in Malay and Javanese, 19.\n If I am not mistaken, the propensity to give certain technical and appropriated titles to couples of certain beasts and birds, which had such an extensive development in old English sporting phraseology, and still partly survives, had its root in the same state of mind, viz. difficulty in grasping the idea of abstract numbers, and a dislike to their use. Some light to me was, many years ago, thrown upon this feeling, and on the origin of the idiom of which we have been speaking, by a passage in a modern book, which is the more noteworthy as the author does not make any reference to the existence of this idiom in any language, and possibly was not aware of it:\n \"On entering into conversation with the (Red) Indian, it becomes speedily apparent that he is unable to comprehend the idea of abstract numbers. They exist in his mind only as associated ideas. He has a distinct conception of five dogs or five deer, but he is so unaccustomed to the idea of number as a thing apart from specific objects, that I have tried in vain to get an Indian to admit that the idea of the number five, as associated in his mind with five dogs, is identical, as far as number is concerned, with that of five fingers.\" -- (Wilson's Prehistoric Man, 1st ed. ii. 470.) [Also see Tylor, Primitive Culture, 2nd ed. i. 252 seqq.].\n Thus it seems probable that the use of the numeral co-efficient, whether in the Malay idiom or in our old sporting phraseology, is a kind of survival of the effort to bridge the difficulty felt, in identifying abstract numbers as applied to different objects, by the introduction of a common concrete term.\n Traces of a like tendency, though probably grown into a mere fashion and artificially developed, are common in Hindustani and Persian, especially in the official written style of munsh\u012bs, who delight in what seemed to me, before my attention was called to the Indo-Chinese idiom, the wilful surplusage (e.g.) of two 'sheets' (fard) of letters, also used with quilts, carpets, &c.; three 'persons' (nafar) of barkand\u0101zes; five 'rope' (r\u0101s) of buffaloes; ten 'chains' (zanj\u012br) of elephants; twenty 'grips' (\u1e33ab\u1e93a) of swords, &c. But I was not aware of the extent of the idiom in the munsh\u012b's repertory till I found it displayed in Mr. Carnegy's Kachahri Technicalities, under the head of Mu\u1e25\u0101wara (Idioms or Phrases). Besides those just quoted, we there find 'adad ('number') used with coins, utensils, and sleeveless garments; d\u0101na ('grain') with pearls and coral beads; dast ('hand') with falcons, &c., shields, and robes of honour; jild (volume, lit. 'skin') with books; muh\u0101r ('nose-bit') with camels; \u1e33i\u1e6da ('portion,' piecey!) with precious stones, gardens, tanks, fields, letters; manzil ('a stage on a journey, an alighting place') with tents, boats, houses, carriages, beds, howdas, &c.; s\u0101z ('an instrument') with guitars, &c.; silk ('thread') with necklaces of all sorts, &c. Several of these, with others purely Turkish, are used also in Osmanli Turkish.*\n", "nuncaties": "s. Rich cakes made by the Mahommedans in W. India chiefly imported into Bombay from Surat.
