{"eagle-wood": "s. The name of an aromatic wood from Camboja and some other Indian regions, chiefly trans-gangetic. It is the \"odorous wood\" referred to by Cam\u00f5es in the quotation under CHAMPA. We have somewhere read an explanation of the name as applied to the substance in question, because this is flecked and mottled, and so supposed to resemble the plumage of an eagle! [Burton, Ar. Nights, iv. 395; Linschoten, Hak. Soc. i. 120, 150.] The word is in fact due to a corrupt form of the Skt. name of the wood, agaru, aguru. A form, probably, of this is aGil, akil, which Gundert gives as the Malay\u0101l. word.* From this the Portuguese must have taken their aguila, as we find it in Barbosa (below), or pao (wood) d'aguila, made into aquila, whence French bois d'aigle, and Eng. eagle-wood. The Malays call it Kay\u016b (wood)-gahru, evidently the same word, though which way the etymology flowed it is difficult to say. [Mr. Skeat writes: \"the question is a difficult one. Klinkert gives garu (garoe) and gaharu (gaharoe), whence the trade names 'Garrow' and 'Garroo'; and the modern standard Malay certainly corresponds to Klinkert's forms, though I think gaharu should rather be written gharu, i.e. with an aspirated g, which is the way the Malays pronounce it. On the other hand, it seems perfectly clear that there must have been an alternative modern form agaru, or perhaps even aguru, since otherwise such trade names as 'ugger' and (?) 'tugger' could not have arisen. They can scarcely Royle says \"Malayan agila,\" but this is apparently a misprint for Malay\u0101lam.\n have come from the Skt. In Ridley's Plant List we have gaharu and gagaheu, which is the regular abbreviation of the reduplicated form gahru-gahru identified as Aquilaria Malaccensis, Lam.\"] [See CAMBULAC.]\n The best quality of this wood, once much valued in Europe as incense, is the result of disease in a tree of the N. O. Leguminosae, the Aloexylonagallochum, Loureiro, growing in Camboja and S. Cochin China, whilst an inferior kind, of like aromatic qualities, is produced by a tree of an entirely different order, Aquilaria agallocha, Roxb. (N. O. Aquilariaceae), which is found as far north as Silhet.*\n Eagle-wood is another name for aloes-wood, or aloes (q.v.) as it is termed in the English Bible. [See Encycl. Bibl. i. 120 seq.] It is curious that Bluteau, in his great Portuguese Vocabulario, under Pao d'Aguila, jumbles up this aloes-wood with Socotrine Aloes. *AGA/LLOXON was known to the ancients, and is described by Dioscorides (c. A.D. 65). In Liddell and Scott the word is rendered \"the bitter aloe\"; which seems to involve the same confusion as that made by Bluteau.\n Other trade-names of the article given by Forbes Watson are Garrow- and Garroo-wood, agla-wood, ugger-, and tugger- (?) wood.\n 1516.- \"Das Dragoarias, e pre\u00e7os que ellas valem em Calicut . . . * * * * * Aguila, cada Farazola (see FRAZALA) de 300 a 400 (fanams) Lenho aloes verdadeiro, negro, pesado, e muito fino val 1000 (fanams).\"\u2020 -- Barbosa (Lisbon), 393.\n 1563. -- \"R.

Review, Oct: 24.\n", "elephant": "s. This article will be confined to notes connected with the various suggestions which have been put forward as to the origin of the word -- a sufficiently ample subject.\n The oldest occurrence of the word (E)LE/FAS -- FANTOS) is in Homer. With him, and so with Hesiod and Pindar, the word means 'ivory.' Herodotus first uses it as the name of the animal (iv. 191). Hence an occasional, probably an erroneous, assumption that the word E)LE/FAS originally meant only the material, and not the beast that bears it.\n In Persian the usual term for the beast is p\u012bl, with which agree the Aramaic p\u012bl (already found in the Chaldee and Syriac versions of the O. T.), and the Arabic f\u012bl. Old etymologists tried to develop elephant out of f\u012bl; and it is natural to connect with it the Spanish for 'ivory' (marfil, Port. marfim), but no satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the first syllable of that word. More certain is the fact that in early Swedish and Danish the word for 'elephant' is fil, in Icelandic fill; a term supposed to have been introduced by old traders from the East via\u0302 Russia. The old Swedish for 'ivory' is filsben.*\n The oldest Hebrew mention of ivory is in the notice of the products brought to Solomon from Ophir, or India. Among these are ivory tusks -- shenhabbim, i.e. 'teeth of habb\u012bm,' a word which has been interpreted as from Skt. ibha, elephant.\u2020 But it is entirely doubtful what this habb\u012bm, occurring here only, really means.\u2021 We know P\u012blu, for elephant, occurs in certain Sanskrit books, but it is regarded as a foreign word.\n See Lassen, i. 313; Max M\u00fcller's Lectures on Sc. of Language, 1st S. p. 189.\n \"As regards the interpretation of habbim, a A(/PAC LEG., in the passage where the state of the text, as shown by comparison with the LXX, is very unsatisfactory, it seems impossible to say anything that can be of the least use in clearing up the origin of elephant. The O. T. speaks so often of ivory, and never again by this name, that habbim must be either a corruption or some tradename, presumably for some special kind of ivory. Personally, I believe it far more likely that habbim is at bottom the same as hobnim (ebony?) associated with shen in Ezekiel xxvii. 15, and that the passage once ran 'ivory and ebony'\" (W. Robertson Smith); [also see Encycl. Bibl. ii. 2297 seq.].\n from other evidence that ivory was known in Egypt and Western Asia for ages before Solomon. And in other cases the Hebrew word for ivory is simply shen, corresponding to dens Indus in Ovid and other Latin writers. In Ezekiel (xxvii. 15) we find karnoth shen='cornua dentis.' The use of the word 'horns' does not necessarily imply a confusion of these great curved tusks with horns; it has many parallels, as in Pliny's, \"cum arbore exacuant limentque cornua elephanti\" (xviii. 7); in Martial's \"Indicoque cornu\" (i. 73); in Aelian's story, as alleged by the Mauritanians, that the elephants there shed their horns every ten years (\"DEKA/TW| E)/TEI PA/NTWS TA\\ KE/RATA E)KPESEI=N\" -- xiv. 5); whilst Cleasby quotes from an Icelandic saga 'olifant-horni' for 'ivory.'\n We have mentioned Skt. ibha, from which Lassen assumes a compound ibhadant\u0101 for ivory, suggesting that this, combined by early traders with the Arabic article, formed al-ibhadant\u0101, and so originated E)LE/FANTOS. Pott, besides other doubts, objects that ibhadant\u0101, though the name of a plant (Tiaridium indicum, Lehm.), is never actually a name of ivory.\n Pott's own etymology is alaf-hindi, 'Indian ox,' from a word existing in sundry resembling forms, in Hebrew and in Assyrian (alif, alap).* This has met with favour; though it is a little hard to accept any form like Hind\u012b as earlier than Homer.\n Other suggested origins are Pictet's from air\u0101vata (lit. 'proceeding from water'), the proper name of the elephant of Indra, or Elephant of the Eastern Quarter in the Hindu Cosmology. \u2020 This is felt to be only too ingenious, but as improbable. It is, however, suggested, it would seem independently, by Mr. Kittel (Indian Antiquary, i. 128), who supposes the first part of the word to be Dravidian, a transformation from \u0101ne, 'elephant.'\n See Zeitschr. f\u00fcr die Kie Kunde des Morgs, iv. 12 seqq.; also Ebehr. Schrader in Zeitsch. d. M. Gesellsch. xxvii. 706 seqq.; [Encycl. Bibl. ii. 1262].\n In Journ. As., ser. iv. tom. ii.\n Pictet, finding his first suggestion not accepted, has called up a Singhalese word aliya, used for 'elephant,' which he takes to be from \u0101la, 'great'; thence aliya, 'great creature'; and proceeding further, presents a combination of \u0101la, 'great,' with Skt. pha\u1e6da, sometimes signifying 'a tooth,' thus ali-pha\u1e6da, 'great tooth'=elephantus.*\n Hodgson, in Notes on Northern Africa (p. 19, quoted by Pott), gives elef ameqran ('Great Boar,' elef being 'boar') as the name of the animal among the Kabyles of that region, and appears to present it as the origin of the Greek and Latin words.\n Again we have the Gothic ulbandus, 'a camel,' which has been regarded by some as the same word with elephantus. To this we shall recur.\n Pott, in his elaborate paper already quoted, comes to the conclusion that the choice of etymologies must lie between his own alaf-hind\u012b and Lassen's al-ibha-dant\u0101. His paper is 50 years old, but he repeats this conclusion in his Wurzel-W\u00f6rterb\u00fcch der Indo-Germanische Sprachen, published in 1871,\u2020 nor can I ascertain that there has been any later advance towards a true etymology. Yet it can hardly be said that either of the alternatives carries conviction.\n Both, let it be observed, apart from other difficulties, rest on the assumption that the knowledge of E)LE/FAS, whether as fine material or as monstrous animal, came from India, whilst nearly all the other or less-favoured suggestions point to the same assumption. \n But knowledge acquired, or at least taken cognizance of, since Pott's latest reference to the subject, puts us in possession of the new and surprising fact that, even in times which we are entitled to call historic, the elephant existed wild, far to the westward of India, and not very far from the eastern extremity of the Mediterranean. Though the fact was indicated from the wall-paintings by Wilkinson some 65 years ago,\u2021 and has more recently been amply displayed in historical works which have circulated by scores in popular libraries, it In Kuhn's Zeitschr. f\u00fcr VergleichendeSprachkunst, iv. 128-131.\n Detmold, pp. 950-952.\n See Topography of Thebes, with a General View of Egypt, 1835, p. 153.\n is singular how little attention or interest it seems to have elicited.*\n The document which gives precise Egyptian testimony to this fact is an inscription (first interpreted by Ebers in 1873)\u2020 from the tomb of Amenemhib, a captain under the great conqueror Thotmes III. [Th\u016btmosis], who reigned B.C. c. 1600. This warrior, speaking from his tomb of the great deeds of his master, and of his own right arm, tells how the king, in the neighbourhood of Ni, hunted 120 elephants for the sake of their tusks; and how he himself (Amenemhib) encountered the biggest of them, which had attacked the sacred person of the king, and cut through its trunk. The elephant chased him into the water, where he saved himself between two rocks; and the king bestowed on him rich rewards.\n The position of Ni is uncertain, though some have identified it with Nineveh.\u2021 [Maspero writes: \"N\u012bi, long confounded with Nineveh, after Champolion (Gram. \u00e9gyptienne, p. 150), was identified by Lenormant (LesOrigines, vol. iii. p. 316 et seq.) with Ninus Vetus, Membidj, and by Max M\u00fcller (Asien und Europa, p. 267) with Balis on the Euphrates: I am inclined to make it Kefer-Naya, between Aleppo and Turman\u012bn\" (Struggle of the Nations, 144, note).] It is named in another inscription between Arinath and Akerith, as, all three, cities of Naharain or Northern Mesopotamia, captured by Amenhotep II., the son of Thotmes III. Might not Ni be Nisibis? We shall find that Assyrian inscriptions of later date have been interpreted as placing elephant-hunts in the land of Harran and in the vicinity of the Chaboras. \n If then these elephant-hunts may be located on the southern skirts of Taurus, we shall more easily understand how a tribute of elephant-tusks should have been offered at the court of Egypt by the people of Rutennu or Northern Syria, and also by the people of the adjacent Asebi or Cyprus, as we find repeatedly recorded on the Egyptian See e.g. Brugsch's Hist. of the Pharaohs, 2d ed. i. 396-400; and Canon Rawlinson's Egypt, ii. 235-6.\n In Z. f\u00fcr Aeqypt. Spr. und Aetferth. 1873, pp. 1-9, 63, 64; also tr. by Dr. Birch in Records of the Past, vol. ii. p. 59 (no date, more shame to S. Bagster & Sons); and again by Ebers, revised in Z.D.M.G., 1876, pp. 391 seqq.\n See Canon Rawlinson's Egypt, u.s.\n monuments, both in hieroglyphic writing and pictorially.*\n What the stones of Egypt allege in the 17th cent. B.C., the stones of Assyria 500 years afterwards have been alleged to corroborate. The great inscription of Tighlath-Pileser I., who is calculated to have reigned about B.C. 1120 1100, as rendered by Lotz, relates:\n \"Ten mighty Elephants Slew I in Harran, and on the banks of the Haboras. Four Elephants I took alive; Their hides, Their teeth, and the live Elephants I brought to my city Assur.\"\u2020\n The same facts are recorded in a later inscription, on the broken obelisk of Assurnazirpal from Kouyunjik, now in the Br. Museum, which commemorates the deeds of the king's ancestor, Tighlath Pileser.\u2021\n In the case of these Assyrian inscriptions, however, elephant is by no means an undisputed interpretation. In the famous quadruple test exercise on this inscription in 1857, which gave the death-blow to the doubts which some sceptics had emitted as to the genuine character of the Assyrian interpretations, Sir H. Rawlinson, in this passage, rendered the animals slain and taken alive as wild buffaloes. The ideogram given as teeth he had not interpreted. The question is argued at length by Lotz in the work already quoted, but it is a question for cuneiform experts, dealing, as it does, with the interpretation of more than one ideogram, and enveloped as yet in uncertainties. It is to be observed, that in 1857 Dr. Hincks, one of the four test-translators,\u0015 had rendered the passage almost exactly as Lotz has done 23 years later, though I cannot see that Lotz makes any allusion to this fact. [See Encycl. Bibl. ii. 1262.] Apart from arguments as to decipherment and ideograms, it is certain that probabilities are much affected by the publication of the Egyptian inscription For the painting see Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, edited by Birch, vol. i. pl. 11 b, which shows the Rutennu bringing a chariot and horses, a bear, an elephant, and ivory tusks, as tribute to Thotmes III. For other records see Brugsch, E.T., 2nd ed. i. 381, 384, 404.\n Die Inschriften Tighlathpileser's I., . . . mit \u00d9bersetzung und Kommentar von Dr. Wilhelm Lotz, Leipzig, 1880, p. 53; [and see Maspero, op. cit. 661 seq.].\n Lotz, loc. cit. p. 197.\n See J.R. As. Soc. vol. xviii.\n of Amenhoteb, which gives a greater plausibility to the rendering 'elephant' than could be ascribed to it in 1857. And should it eventually be upheld, it will be all the more remarkable that the sagacity of Dr. Hincks should then have ventured on that rendering.\n In various suggestions, including Pott's, besides others that we have omitted, the etymology has been based on a transfer of the name of the ox, or some other familiar quadruped. There would be nothing extraordinary in such a transfer of meaning. The reference to the bos Luca* is trite; the Tibetan word for ox (glan) is also the word for 'elephant'; we have seen how the name 'Great Boar' is alleged to be given to the elephant among the Kabyles; we have heard of an elephant in a menagerie being described by a Scotch rustic as 'a muckle sow'; Pausanias, according to Bochart, calls rhinoceroses 'Aethiopic bulls' [Bk. ix. 21, 2]. And let me finally illustrate the matter by a circumstance related to me by a brother officer who accompanied Sir Neville Chamberlain on an expedition among the turbulent Pathan tribes c. 1860. The women of the villages gathered to gaze on the elephants that accompanied the force, a stranger sight to them than it would have been to the women of the most secluded village in Scotland. 'Do you see these?' said a soldier of the Frontier Horse; 'do you know what they are? These are the Queen of England's buffaloes that give 5 maunds (about 160 quarts) of milk a day!'\n Now it is an obvious suggestion, that if there were elephants on the skirts of Taurus down to B.C. 1100, or even (taking the less questionable evidence) down only to B.C. 1600, it is highly improbable that the Greeks would have had to seek a name for the animal, or its tusk, from Indian trade. And if the Greeks had a vernacular name for the elephant, there is also a proba \"Inde boves Lucas turrito corpore tetros, Anguimanos, belli docuerunt volnera P\u0153nei Sufferre, et magnas Martis turbare catervas.\" Lucretius, v. 1301-3.\n Here is the origin of Tennyson's 'serpent-hands' quoted under HATTY. The title bos Luca is explained by St. Isidore:\n \"Hos boves Lucanos vocabant antiqui Romani: boves quia nullum animal grandius videbant: Lucanos quia in Lucania illos primus Pyrrhus in pr\u0153lio objecit Romanis.\" -- Isid. Hispal. lib. xii. Originum, cap. 2.\n bility, if not a presumption, that some tradition of this name would be found, mutatis mutandis, among other Aryan nations of Europe.\n Now may it not be that E)LE/FAS- FAVTOS in Greek, and ulbandus in MoesoGothic, represent this vernacular name? The latter form is exactly the modification of the former which Grimm's law demands. Nor is the word confined to Gothic. It is found in the Old H. German (olpenta\u0302); in Anglo-Saxon (olfend, oluend, &c.); in Old Swedish (aelpand, alwandyr, ulfwald); in Icelandic (ulfaldi). All these Northern words, it is true, are used in the sense of camel, not of elephant. But instances already given may illustrate that there is nothing surprising in this transfer, all the less where the animal originally indicated had long been lost sight of. Further, J\u00fclg, who has published a paper on the Gothic word, points out its resemblance to the Slav forms welbond, welblond, or wielblad, also meaning 'camel' (compare also Russian verbliud). This, in the last form (wielblad), may, he says, be regarded as resolvable into 'Great beast.' Herr J\u00fclg ends his paper with a hint that in this meaning may perhaps be found a solution of the origin of elephant (an idea at which Pictet also transiently pointed in a paper referred to above), and half promises to follow up this hint; but in thirty years he has not done so, so far as I can discover. Nevertheless it is one which may yet be pregnant.\n Nor is it inconsistent with this suggestion that we find also in some of the Northern languages a second series of names designating the elephant -- not, as we suppose ulbandus and its kin to be, common vocables descending from a remote age in parallel development -- but adoptions from Latin at a much more recent period. Thus, we have in Old and Middle German Elefant and Helfant, with elfenbein and helfenbein for ivory; in Anglo-Saxon, ylpend, elpend, with shortened forms ylp and elp, and ylpenban for ivory; whilst the Scandinavian tongues adopt and retain fil. [The N.E.D. regards the derivation as doubtful, but considers the theory of Indian origin improbable.\n [A curious instance of misapprehension is the use of the term 'Chain elephants.' This is a misunderstanding of the ordinary locution zanj\u012br-i-f\u012bl when speaking of elephants. Zanj\u012br is literally a 'chain,' but is here akin to our expressions, a 'pair,' 'couple,' 'brace' of anything. It was used, no doubt, with reference to the iron chain by which an elephant is hobbled. In an account 100 elephants would be entered thus: F\u012bl, Zanj\u012br, 100. (See NUMERICAL AFFIXES.)]\n [1826. -- \"Very frequent mention is made in Asiatic histories of chain - elephants; which always mean elephants trained for war; but it is not very clear why they are so denominated.\" -- Ranking, Hist.

An island in Bombay Harbour, the native name of which is Gh\u0101r\u0101pur\u012b (or sometimes, it would seem, shortly, Pur\u012b), famous for its magnificent excavated temple, considered by Burgess to date after the middle of the 8th cent. The name was given by the Portuguese from the life-size figure of an elephant, hewn from an isolated mass of trap-rock, which formerly stood in the lower part of the island, not far from the usual landing-place. This figure fell down many years ago, and was often said to have disappeared. But it actually lay in situ till 1864-5, when (on the suggestion of the late Mr. W. E. Frere) it was removed by Dr. (now Sir) George Birdwood to the Victoria Gardens at Bombay, in order to save the relic from destruction. The elephant had originally a smaller figure on its back, which several of the earlier authorities speak of as a young elephant, but which Mr. Erskine and Capt. Basil Hall regarded as a tiger. The horse mentioned by Fryer remained in 1712; it had disappeared apparently before Niebuhr's visit in 1764.

It is so called because of a great elephant of stone, which one sees in entering the river. They say that it was made by the orders of a heathen king called Banasur, who ruled the whole country inland from the Ganges. . . . On the left side of this chapel is a doorway 6 palms in depth and 5 in width, by which one enters a chamber which is nearly square and very dark, so that there is nothing to be seen there; and with this ends the fabric of this great pagoda. It has been in many parts demolished; and what the soldiers have left is so maltreated that it is grievous to see destroyed in such fashion one of the Wonders of the World. It is now 50 years since I went to see this marvellous Pagoda; and as I did not then visit it with such curiosity as I should now feel in doing so, I failed to remark many particulars which exist no longer. But I do remember me to have seen a certain Chapel, not to be seen now, open on the whole fa\u00e7ade (which was more than 40 feet in length), and which along the rock formed a plinth the whole length of the edifice, fashioned like our altars both as to breadth and height; and on this plinth were many remarkable things to be seen.
