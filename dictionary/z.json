This whimsical name, applied in zoological books, English as well as French, to the humped domestic ox (or Brahminy bull) of India, was taken by Buffon from the exhibitors of such a beast at a French fair, who perhaps invented the word, but who told him the beast had been brought from Africa, where it was called by that name. We have been able to discover no justification for this in African dialects, though our friend Mr. R. Cust has kindly made search, and sought information from other philologists on our account. Zebu passes, however, with most people as an Indian word; thus Webster's Dictionary, says \"Zebu, the native Indian name.\" The only word at all like it that we can discover is zobo (q.v.) or zhobo, applied in the semi-Tibetan regions of the Him\u0101laya to a useful hybrid, called in Ladak by the slightly modified form dsomo. In J\u00e4schke's Tibetan Dict. we find \"Ze'-ba . . . . l. hump of a camel, zebu, etc.\" This is curious, but, we should think, only one of those coincidences which we have had so often to notice.\n Isidore Geoffroy de St. Hilaire, in his work Acclimatation et Domestication des Animaux Utiles, considers the ox and the zebu to be two distinct species. Both are figured on the Assyrian monuments, and both on those of ancient Egypt. The humped ox also exists in Southern Persia, as Marco Polo mentions. Still, the great naturalist to whose work we have referred is hardly justified in the statement quoted below, that the \"zebu\" is common to \"almost the whole of Asia\" with a great part of Africa. [Mr. Blanford writes: \"The origin of Bos indicus (sometimes called zebu by European naturalists) is unknown, but it was in all probability tropical or sub-tropical, and was regarded by Blyth as probably African. No ancestral form has been discovered among Indian fossil bovines, which . . . comprise species allied to the gaur and buffalo\" (Mammalia, 483. seq.).]\n c. 1772. -- \"We have seen this small hunched ox alive. . . . It was shown at the fair in Paris in 1752 (sic, but a transcript from the French edition of 1837 gives 1772) under the name of Zebu; which we have adopted to describe the animal by, for it is a particular breed of the ox, and not a species of the buffalo.\" -- Buffon's Nat.

The former is Arabic jadw\u0101r, the latter Pers. zaramb\u0101d. There seems some doubt about the scientific discrimination of the two. Moodeen Sheriff says that Zedoary (Curcuma zedoaria) is sold in most bazars under the name of a\u1e45behald\u012b, whilst jadv\u0101r, or zhadv\u0101r, is the bazar name of roots of varieties of non-poisonous aconites.

Zend is the name which has been commonly applied, for more than a hundred years to that dialect of the ancient Iranian (or Persian) language in which the Avesta or Sacred Booksof Zorastrianism or the old Persian religion are written. The application of the name in this way was quite erroneous, as the word Zand when used alone in the Parsi books indicates a 'commentary or explanation,' and is in fact applied only to some Pahlavi translation, commentary, or gloss. If the name Zend were now to be used as the designation of any language it would more justly apply to the Pahlavi itself. At the same time Haug thinks it probable that the term Zand was originally applied to a commentary written in the same language as the Avesta itself, for in the Pahlavi translations of the Yasna, a part of the Avesta, where the scriptures are mentioned, Avesta and Zend are coupled together, as of equal authority, which could hardly have been the case if by Zend the translator meant his own work. No name for the language of the ancient scriptures has been found in the Parsi books; and Avesta itself has been adopted by scholars in speaking of the language. The fragments of these scriptures are written in two dialects of the Eastern Iranian, one, the more ancient, in which the G\u0101thas or hymns are written; and a later one which was for many centuries the spoken and written language of Bactria.\n The word Zand, in Haug's view, may be referred to the root zan, 'to know'; Skt. jn\u0101, Gr. GNW, Lat. gno (as in agnosco, cognosco), so that its meaning is 'knowledge.' Prof. J. Oppert, on the other hand, identifies it with old Pers. zannda, 'prayer.'\n Zendavesta is the name which has been by Europeans popularly applied to the books just spoken of as the Avesta. The term is undoubtedly an inversion, as, according to Haug, \"the Pahlavi books always style them Avista\u0302k va Zand (Avesta and Zend)\" i.e. the Law with its traditional and authoritative explanation. Abasta\u0302, in the sense of law, occurs in the funeral inscription of Darius at Behist\u016bn; and this seems now the most generally accepted origin of the term in its application to the Parsi sacred books. (This is not, however, the explanation given by Haug.) Thus, 'Avesta and Zend' signify together 'The Law and the Commentary.'\n The Avesta was originally much more extensive than the texts which now exist, which are only fragments. The Parsi tradition is that there were twenty - one books called Nasks, the greater part of which were burnt by Alexander in his conquest of Persia; possibly true, as we know that Alexander did burn the palace at Persepolis. The collection of fragments which remains, and is known as the Zend-avesta, is divided, in its usual form, into two parts. I. The Avesta properly so called, containing (a) the Vend\u00eeda\u0302d, a compilation of religious laws and of mythical tales; (b) the Visp\u00earad, a collection of litanies for the sacrifice; and (c) the Yasna, composed of similar litanies and of 5 hymns or Ga\u0302thas in an old dialect. II. The Khorda, or small, Avesta, composed of short prayers for recitation by the faithful at certain moments of the day, month, or year, and in presence of the different elements, with which certain other hymns and fragments are usually included.\n The term Zendavesta, though used, as we see below, by Lord in 1630, first became familiar in Europe through the labours of Anquetil du Perron, and his publication of 1771.

This word is properly Ar. (in Indian pron.) zila, 'a rib,' thence 'a side,' a district. It is the technical name for the administrative districts into which British India is divided, each of which has in the older provinces a Collector, or Collector and Magistrate combined, a Sessions Judge, &c., and in the newer provinces, such as the Punjab and B.

This is of course not Anglo-Indian, but the name applied in various countries of Europe, and in various modifications, zincari, zingani, zincali, chingari, zigeuner, &c., to the gypsies.\n Various suggestions as to its derivation have been made on the supposition that it is of Indian origin. Borrow has explained the word as 'a person of mixt blood,' deriving it from the Skt. sankara, 'made up.' It is true that var\u1e45a sankara is used for an admixture of castes and races (e.g. in Bh\u0101gavad G\u012bt\u0101, i. 41, &c.), but it is not the name of any caste, nor would people to whom such an opprobrious epithet had been applied be likely to carry it with them to distant lands. A writer in the Saturday Review once suggested the Pers. z\u012bngar, 'a saddler.' Not at all probable. In Sleeman's Ramaseeana or Vocabulary of the peculiar Language used by the Thugs (Calcutta, 1836), p. 85, we find:\n \"Chingaree, a class of Multani Thugs, sometimes called Naiks, of the Mussulman faith. They proceed on their expeditions in the character of Brinjaras, with cows and bullocks laden with merchandize, which they expose for sale at their encampments, and thereby attract their victims. They use the rope of their bullocks instead of the roomal in strangling. They are an ancient tribe of Thugs, and take their wives and children on their expeditions.\"\n [These are the Ch\u0101ngars of whom Mr. Ibbetson (Panjab Ethnog. 308) gives an account. A full description of them has been given by Dr. G. W. Leitner (A Sketch of the Changars and of their Dialect, Lahore, 1880), in which he shows reason to doubt any connection between them and the Zingari.] De Goeje (Contributions to the Hist. of the Gypsies) regards that people as the Indian Zo\u1e6d\u1e6d (i.e. Jatt of Sind). He suggests as possible origins of the name first shik\u0101r\u012b (see SHIKAREE), and then Pers. chang\u012b, 'harper,' from which a plural chang\u0101n actually occurs in Lane's Arabian Nights, iii. 730, note 22. [These are the Al-Jink, male dancers (see Burton, Ar. Nights, viii. 18).]\n If the name is to be derived from India, the term in Sleeman's Vocabulary seems a more probable origin than the others mentioned here. But is it not more likely that zingari, like Gipsy and Bohemian, would be a name given ab extra on their appearing in the West, and not carried with them from Asia?\n", "zirbad": "n.p. Pers. z\u012br-b\u0101d, 'below the wind,' i.e. leeward. This is a phrase derived from nautical use, and applied to the countries eastward of India. It appears to be adopted with reference to the S.W. Monsoon. Thus by the extracts from the Mohit or 'Ocean' of Sidi 'Ali Kapud\u0101n (1554), translated by Joseph V. Hammer in the Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, we find that one chapter (unfortunately not given) treats \"Of the Indian Islands above and below the wind.\" The islands \"above the wind\" were probably Ceylon, the Maldives, Socotra, &c., but we find no extract with precise indication of them. We find however indicated as the \"tracts situated below the wind\" Malacca, Sumatra, Tenasserim, Bengal, Martaban, Pegu. The phrase is one which naturally acquires a specific meaning among sea-faring folk, of which we have an instance in the Windward and Leeward Islands of the W. Indies. But probably it was adopted from the Malays, who make use of the same nomenclature, as the quotations show.\n 1442. -- \"The inhabitants of the sea coasts arrive here (at Ormuz) from the countries of Tchin, Java, Bengal, the cities of Zirbad.\" -- Abdurrazz\u0101k, in India in the X Vth Cent. 6.\n 1553. -- \". . . Before the foundation of Malaca, in this Cingapura . . . met all the navigators of the seas to the West of India and of those to the East of it, which last embrace the regions of Siam, China, Choampa, Camboja, and the many thousand islands that lie in that Orient. And these two quarters the natives of the land distinguish as Dybananguim (di-b\u0101wa-ang\u012bn) and Ataz Anguim (\u0101tas-ang\u012bn) which are as much as to say 'below the winds' and 'above the winds,' below being West and above East.\" -- Barros, Dec. II. Liv. vi. cap. i. In this passage De Barros goes unusually astray, for the use of the Malay expressions which he quotes, bawa-angin (or di-bawah) 'below the wind,' and \u0101tas (or di-\u0101tas) ang\u012bn, 'above the wind,' is just the reverse of his explanation, the former meaning the east, and the latter the west (see below).\n c. 1590. -- \"Kalanbak (see CALAMBAK) is the wood of a tree brought from Z\u00edrb\u00e1d (?)\" -- \u0100\u012bn, i. 81. A mistaken explanation is given in the foot-note from a native authority, but this is corrected by Prof. Blochmann at p. 616.\n 1726. -- \"The Malayers are also commonly called Orang di Bawah Angin, or 'people beneath the wind,' otherwise Easterlings, as those of the West, and particularly the Arabs, are called Orang Atas Angin, or 'people above the wind,' and known as Westerlings.\" -- Valentijn, v. 310.\n \" \"The land of the Peninsula, &c., was called by the geographers Zierbaad, meaning in Persian 'beneath the wind.'\" -- Ibid. 317.\n 1856. -- \"There is a peculiar idiom of the Malay language, connected with the monsoons. . . . The Malays call all countries west of their own 'countries above the wind,' and their own and all countries east of it 'countries below the wind.' . . . The origin of the phrase admits of no explanation, unless it have reference to the most important of the two monsoons, the western, that which brought to the Malayan countries the traders of India.\"- Crawfurd's Desc. Dict. 288.\n", "zobo": "&c., s. Names used in the semi-Tibetan tracts of the Him\u0101laya for hybrids between the yak bull and the ordinary hill cow, much used in transport and agriculture. See quotation under ZEBU. The following are the connected Tibetan terms, according to Jaeschke's Dict. (p. 463): \"mdzo, a mongrel bred of Yak bull and common cow; bri-mdzo, a mongrel bred of common bull and yak cow; mdzopo, a male; mdzo-mo, a female animal of the kind, both valued as domestic cattle.\" [Writing of the Lower Him\u0101laya, Mr. Atkinson says: \"When the sire is a yak and the dam a hill cow, the hybrid is called jubu; when the parentage is reversed, the produce is called garjo.

Messer Marco brought some to Venice as a great curiosity, and so it was reckoned by those who saw it. There are also plenty of them tame, which have been caught young. They also cross these with the common cow, and the cattle from this cross are wonderful beasts, and better for work than other animals.

Pers. zamb\u016brak (spelt zanb\u016brak), a small gun or swivel usually carried on a camel, and mounted on a saddle;a falconet. [See a drawing in R. Kipling's Beast and Man in India, 255.] It was, however, before the use of gunpowder came in, the name applied sometimes to a cross-bow, and sometimes to the quarrel or bolt shot from such a weapon. The word is in form a Turkish diminutive from Ar. zamb\u016br, 'a hornet'; much as 'musket' comes from mosquetta. Quatrem\u00e8re thinks the name was given from the twang of the cross-bow at the moment of discharge (see H. des Mongols, 285-6; see also Dozy, Suppt. s.v.).
