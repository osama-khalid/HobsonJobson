{"tabasheer": "s. 'Sugar of Bamboo.' A siliceous substance sometimes found in the joints of the bamboo, formerly prized as medicine, [also known in India as B\u0101nslochan or B\u0101nskap\u016br]. The word is Pers. tab\u0101sh\u012br, but that is from the Skt. name of the article, tvakksh\u012bra, and tavakksh\u012bra.  The substance is often confounded, in name at least, by the old Materia Medica writers, with spodium and is sometimes called ispodio di canna. See Ces. Federici below. Garcia De Orta goes at length into this subject (f. 193 seqq.). [See SUGAR.]\n c. 1150. -- \"Tanah (miswritten Banah) est une jolie ville situ\u00e9e sur un grand golfe. . . .

This is the trade-name of the Chinese ounce, viz., 1\u204416 of a catty (q.v.); and also of the Chinese money of account, often called \"the ounce of silver,\" but in Chinese called liang. The standard liang or tael is, according to Dr. Wells Williams,=579\u00b784 grs. troy. It was formerly equivalent to a string of 1000 tsien, or (according to the trade-name) cash (q.v.). The China tael used to be reckoned as worth 6s. 8d., but the rate really varied with the price of silver. In 1879 an article in the Fortnightly Review puts it at 5s. 7\u00bdd. (Sept. p. 362); the exchange at Shanghai in London by telegraphic transfer, April 13, 1885, was 4s. 9\u215cd.; [on Oct. 3, 1901, 2s. 7\u00bcd.]. The word was apparently got from the Malays, among whom ta\u00efl or tahil is the name of a weight; and this again, as Crawfurd indicates, is probably from the India tola (q.v.). [Mr. Pringle writes: \"Sir H. Yule does not refer to such forms as tahe (see below), taies (plural in Fryer's New Account, p. 210, sub Machawo), Taye (see quotation below from Saris), tayes (see quotation below from Mocquet), or taey, and taeys (Philip's translation of Linschoten, Hak. Soc. i. 149). These probably come through the medium of the Portuguese, in which the final l of the singular tael is changed into s in the plural. Such a form as taeis might easily suggest a singular wanting the final s, and from such a singular French and English plurals of the ordinary type would in turn be fashioned\" (Diary Ft. St. Geo., 1st ser. ii. 126).]\n The Chinese scale of weight, with their trade-names, runs: 16 taels=1 catty, 100 catties=1 pecul=133\u00bd lbs. avoird. Milburn gives the weights of Achin as 4 copangs (see KOPANG)=1 mace, 5 mace=1 mayam, 16 mayam= 1 tale (see TAEL), 5 tales=1 buncal, 20 buncals=1 catty, 200 catties=1 bahar; and the catty of Ach\u012bn as=2 lbs. 1 oz. 13 dr. Of these names, mace, tale and bahar (qq.v.) seem to be of Indian origin, mayam, bangkal, and kati Malay.\n 1540. -- \"And those three junks which were then taken, according to the assertion of those who were aboard, had contained in silver alone 200,000 taels (taeis), which are in our money 300,000 cruzados, besides much else of value with which they were freighted.\" -- Pinto, cap. xxxv.\n 1598. -- \"A Tael is a full ounce and a halfe Portingale weight.\" -- Linschoten, 44; [Hak.

This bird is so called from the fact that it is in the habit of drawing together \"one leaf or more, generally two leaves, on each side of the nest, and stitches them together with cotton, either woven by itself, or cotton thread picked up; and after putting the thread through the leaf, it makes a knot at the end to fix it\" (Jerdon).

The name by which the chief race inhabiting Pegu (or the Delta of the Irawadi) is known to the Burmese. The Talaings were long the rivals of the Burmese, alternately conquering and conquered, but the Burmese have, on the whole, so long predominated, even in the Delta, that the use of the Talaing language is now nearly extinct in Pegu proper, though it is still spoken in Martaban, and among the descendants of emigrants into Siamese territory. We have adopted the name from the Burmese to designate the race, but their own name for their people is Mo\u0304n or M\u016bn (see MONE).\n Sir Arthur Phayre has regarded the name Talaing as almost undoubtedly a form of Telinga. The reasons given are plausible, and may be briefly stated in two extracts from his Essay On the History of Pegu (J. As. Soc. Beng., vol. xlii. Pt. i.): \"The names given in the histories of Tha-htun and Pegu to the first Kings of those cities are Indian; but they cannot be accepted as historically true. The countries from which the Kings are said to have derived their origin . . . may be recognised as Karn\u00e1ta, Kalinga, Venga and Vizianagaram . . . probably mistaken for the more famous Vijayanagar. . . . The word Taling\u00e1na never occurs in the Peguan histories, but only the more ancient name Kalinga\" (op. cit. pp. 32-33). \"The early settlement of a colony or city for trade, on the coast of R\u00e1manya by settlers from Taling\u00e1na, satisfactorily accounts for the name Talaing, by which the people of Pegu are known to the Burmese and all peoples of the west. But the Peguans call themselves by a different name . . . Mun, Mwun, or Mon\" (ibid. p. 34).\n Prof. Forchhammer, however, who has lately devoted much labour to the study of Talaing archaeology and literature, entirely rejects this view. He states that prior to the time of Alompra's conquest of Pegu (middle of 18th century) the name Talaing was entirely unknown as an appellation of the Muns, and that it nowhere occurs in either inscriptions or older palm-leaves, and that by all nations of Further India the people in question is known by names related to either Mun or Pegu. He goes on: \"The word 'Talaing' is the term by which the Muns acknowledged their total defeat, their being vanquished and the slaves of their Burmese conqueror. They were no longer to bear the name of Muns or Peguans. Alompra stigmatized them with an appellation suggestive at once of their submission and disgrace. Talaing means\" (in the Mun language) \"'one who is trodden under foot, a slave.' . . . Alompra could not have devised more effective means to extirpate the national consciousness of a people than by burning their books, forbidding the use of their language, and by substituting a term of abject reproach for the name under which they had maintained themselves for nearly 2000 years in the marine provinces of Burma. The similarity of the two words 'Talaing' and 'Telingana' is purely accidental; and all deductions, historical or etymological . . . from the resemblance . . . must necessarily be void ab initio\" (Notes on Early Hist. and Geog. of Br. Burma, Pt. ii. pp. 11-12, Rangoon, 1884).\n Here we leave the question. It is not clear whether Prof. F. gives the story of Alompra as a historical fact, or as a probable explanation founded on the etymology. Till this be clear we cannot say that we are altogether satisfied. But the fact that we have been unable to find any occurrence of Talaing earlier than Symes's narrative is in favour of his view.\n Of the relics of Talaing literature almost nothing is known. Much is to be hoped from the studies of Prof. Forchhammer himself.\n There are linguistic reasons for connecting the Talaing or Mun people with the so-called Kolarian tribes of the interior of India, but the point is not yet a settled one. [Mr. Baines notes coincidences between the Mon and Munda languages, and accepts the connection of Talaing with Telinga (Census Report, 1891, i. p. 128).]\n 1795. -- \"The present King of the Birmans . . . has abrogated some severe penal laws imposed by his predecessors on the Taliens, or native Peguers. Justice is now impartially distributed, and the only distinction at present between a Birman and a Talien, consists in the exclusion of the latter from places of public trust and power.\" -- Symes, 183.\n", "talapoin": "s. A word used by the Portuguese, and after them by French and other Continental writers, as well as by some English travellers of the 17th century, to designate the Buddhist monks of Ceylon and the Indo-Chinese countries. The origin of the expression is obscure. Monseigneur Pallegoix, in his Desc. du Royaume Thai ou Siam (ii. 23) says: \"Les Europ\u00e9ens les ont appel\u00e9s talapoins, probablement du nom de l'\u00e9ventail qu'ils tiennent \u00e0 la main, lequel s'appelle talapat, qui signifie feuille de palmier.\" Childers gives Talapannam, Pali, 'a leaf used in writing, &c.' This at first sight seems to have nothing to support it except similarity of sound; but the quotations from Pinto throw some possible light, and afford probability to this origin, which is also accepted by Koeppen (Rel. des Buddhas, i. 331 note), and by Bishop Bigandet (J. Ind. Archip. iv. 220). [Others, however, derive it from Peguan Tilapoin, tala (not tila), 'lord,' poin, 'wealth.']\n c. 1554. -- \". . . hu\u0303a procissa\u0303o . . . na qual se affirmou . . . que hia\u0303o quarenta mil Sacerdotes . . . dos quaes muytos tinha\u0303o differentes dignidades, come era\u0303o Grepos (?), Talagrepos, Rolins, Neepois, Bicos, Sacareus e Chanfarauhos, os quaes todas pelas vestiduras, de que hia\u0303o ornados, e pelas divisas, e insignias, que levara\u0303o nas ma\u0303os, se conhecia\u0303o, quaes era\u0303o huno, e quaes era\u0303o outros.\" -- F.

These Mahommedan tahl\u012bls were worn by a band, and were the origin of the Span. word tali, 'a baldrick.'

Bedwell, the father of English Arabists, in his Catalogue of the Chapters of the Turkish Alkoran, published (1615) along with the Mohammedis Imposturae, and ArabianTrudgman, has the following, quoted from Postellus de Orbis Concordia, i. 13: 'Haec precatio (the f\u0101ti\u1e25a) illis est communis ut nobis dominica: et ita quibusdum ad battologiam usque recitatur ut centies idem, aut duo aut tria vocabula repetant dicendo, Alhamdu lillah, hamdu lillah, hamdu lillah, et cetera ejus vocabula eodem modo.

Quidam medio in campo tam assidu\u00e8, ut defessi considant; alii circumgirando corpus,' etc.\n \"Here then we have a form without the s, and one which from the vowels seem to be ti'lima, 'a very learned man.' This, owing to the influence of the guttural, would sound in modern pronunciation nearly as Taalima. At the same time ti'lima is not the name of an office, and prayers on behalf of others can be undertaken by any one who receives a mandate, and is paid for them; so it is very possible that Postellus, who was an Arabic scholar, made the pointing suit his idea of the word meant, and that the real word is tal\u0101mi, a shortened form, recognised by Jawhari, and other lexicographers, of tal\u0101midh, 'disciples.' That students should turn a penny by saying prayers for others is very natural.\" This, therefore, confirms our conjecture of the origin.\n 1338. -- \"They treated me civilly, and set me in front of their mosque during their Easter; at which mosque, on account of its being their Easter, there were assembled from divers quarters a number of their Cadini, i.e. of their bishops, and of their Talismani, i.e. of their priests.\" -- Letter of Friar Pascal, in Cathay, &c., p. 235.\n 1471. -- \"In questa citt\u00e0 \u00e8 vna fossa d'acqua nel modo di vna fontana, la qual' \u00e8 guardata da quelli suoi Thalassimani, cio\u00e8 preti; quest' acqua dicono che ha gran vert\u00f9 contra la lebra, e contra le caualette.\" -- Giosafa Barbaro, in Ramusio, ii. f. 107.\n 1535.- \"Non vi sarebbe pi\u00f9 confusione S'a Damasco il Soldan desse l'assalto; Un muover d'arme, un correr di persone E di talacimanni un gridar d'alto.\" Ariosto, xviii. 7.\n 1554. -- \"Talism\u00e1nnos habent hominum genus templorum ministerio dicatum. . . .\" Busbeq.

India it is the subdivision of a district, presided over as regards revenue matters by a tahseeldar. In Bengal it is applied to tracts of proprietary land, sometimes not easily distinguished from Zemindaries, and sometimes subordinate to or dependent on Zemindars. In the N.W. Prov. and Oudh the ta'alluk is an estate the profits of which are divided between different proprietors, one being superior, the other inferior (see TALOOKDAR). Ta'allu\u1e33 is also used in Hind. for 'department' of administration.\n 1885. -- \"In October, 1779, the Dacca Council were greatly disturbed in their minds by the appearance amongst them of John Doe, who was then still in his prime.

The tree is not believed by Dr. Brandis to be indigenous in India, but is supposed to be so in tropical Africa. The origin of the name is curious. It is Ar. tamar-u'l-Hind, 'date of India,' or perhaps rather in Persian form, tamar-i-Hind\u012b.

Mem. 2nd ed. ii. 5.]\n", "tanga": "s. Mahr. tank, Turki tanga. A denomination of coin which has been in use over a vast extent of territory, and has varied greatly in application. It is now chiefly used in Turkestan, where it is applied to a silver coin worth about 7\u00bdd. And Mr. W. Erskine has stated that the word tanga or tanka is of Chagatai Turki origin, being derived from tang, which in that language means 'white' (H. of Baber and Humayun, i. 546). Though one must hesitate in differing from one usually so accurate, we must do so here. He refers to Josafa Barbaro, who says this, viz. that certain silver coins are called by the Mingrelians tetari, by the Greeks aspri, by the Turks akcha, and by the Zagatais tengh, all of which words in the respective languages signify 'white.' We do not however find such a word in the dictionaries of either Vamb\u00e9ry or of Pavet de Courteille; -- the latter only having tangah, 'fer-blanc.' And the obvious derivation is the Skt. \u1e6da\u1e45ka, 'a weight (of silver) equal to 4 m\u0101shas . . . a stamped coin.' The word in the forms \u1e6dak\u0101 (see TUCKA) and \u1e6danga (for these are apparently identical in origin) is, \"in all dialects, laxly used for money in general\" (Wilson).\n In the Lahore coinage of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazn\u012b, A.H. 418-419 (A.D. 1027-28), we find on the Skt. legend of the reverse the word \u1e6dtanka in correspondence with the dirham of the Ar. obverse (see Thomas, Pathan Kings, p. 49). \u1e6canka or Tanga seems to have continued to be the popular name of the chief silver coin of the Delhi sovereigns during the 13th and first part of the 14th centuries, a coin which was substantially the same with the rupee (q.v.) of later days. In fact this application of the word in the form \u1e6dak\u0101 (see TUCKA) is usual in Bengal down to our own day. Ibn Batuta indeed, who was in India in the time of Mahommed Tughlak, 1333 1343 or thereabouts, always calls the gold coin then current a tanka or d\u012bn\u0101r of gold. It was, as he repeatedly states, the equivalent of 10 silver d\u012bn\u0101rs. These silver d\u012bn\u0101rs (or rupees) are called by the author of the Mas\u0101lik-al-Abs\u0101r (c. 1340) the \"silver tanka of India.\" The gold and silver tanka continue to be mentioned repeatedly in the history of Feroz Sh\u0101h, the son of Mahommed (1351 1388), and apparently with the same value as before. At a later period under Sikandar Buhlol (1488-1517), we find black (or copper) tankas, of which 20 went to the old silver tanka.\n We cannot say when the coin, or its name rather, first appeared in Turkestan.\n But the name was also prevalent on the western coast of India as that of a low denomination of coin, as may be seen in the quotations from Linschoten and Grose. Indeed the name still survives in Goa as that of a copper coin equivalent to 60 reis or about 2d. And in the 16th century also 60 reis appears from the papers of Gerson da Cunha to have been the equivalent of the silver tanga of Goa and Bassein, though all the equations that he gives suggest that the rei may have been more valuable then.\n The denomination is also found in Russia under the form dengi. See a quotation under COPECK, and compare PARDAO.\n c. 1335. -- \"Ac\u00e7ording to what I have heard from the Shaikh Mubarak, the red lak (see LACK) contains 100,000 golden tankahs, and the white lak 100,000 (silver) tankahs.

A reservoir, an artificial pond or lake, made either by excavation or by damming. This is one of those perplexing words which seem to have a double origin, in this case one Indian, the other European.\n As regards what appears to be the Indian word, Shakespear gives: \"T\u0101nk'h (in Guzerat), an underground reservoir for water.\" [And so Platts.] Wilson gives: \"T\u00e1nke\u1e47 or t\u00e1ke\u1e47, Mahr. . . . T\u00e1nkh (said to be Guzer\u00e1th\u00ed). A reservoir of water, an artificial pond, commonly known to Europeans in India as a Tank. \u1e6c\u00e1nki, Guz. A reservoir of water; a small well.\" R. Drummond, in his Illustrations of Guzerattee, &c., gives: \"Tanka (Mah.) and Tankoo (Guz.) Reservoirs, constructed of stone or brick or lime, of larger and lesser size, generally inside houses. . . . They are almost entirely covered at top, having but a small aperture to let a pot or bucket down.\" . . . \"In the towns of Bikaner,\" says Tod, \"most families have large cisterns or reservoirs called Tankas, filled by the rains\" (Rajputana, ii. 202). Again, speaking of towns in the desert of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, he says: \"they collect the rain water in reservoirs called Tanka, which they are obliged to use sparingly, as it is said to produce night blindness\" (ii. 300). Again, Dr. Spilsbury (J.A.S.B. ix. pt. 2, 891), describing a journey in the Nerbudda Basin, cites the word, and notes: \"I first heard this word used by a native in the Betool district; on asking him if at the top of Bowergurh there was any spring, he said No, but there was a Tanka or place made of pukka (stone and cement) for holding water.\" Once more, in an Appendix to the Report of the Survey of India for 1881-1882, Mr. G. A. MacGill, speaking of the rain cisterns in the driest part of Rajputana, says: \"These cisterns or wells are called by the people t\u00e1nk\u00e1s\" (App. p. 12). See also quotation below from a Report by Major Strahan. It is not easy to doubt the genuineness of the word, which may possibly be from Skt. ta\u1e0daga, ta\u1e6d\u0101ga, ta\u1e6d\u0101ka, 'a pond, pool, or tank.'\n Fr. Paolino, on the other hand, says the word tanque used by the Portuguese in India was Portoghesa corrotta, which is vague. But in fact tanque is a word which appears in all Portuguese dictionaries, and which is used by authors so early after the opening of communication with India (we do not know if there is an instance actually earlier) that we can hardly conceive it to have been borrowed from an Indian language, nor indeed could it have been borrowed from Guzerat and Rajp\u016bt\u0101na, to which the quotations above ascribe the vernacular word. This Portuguese word best suits, and accounts for that application of tank to large sheets of water which is habitual in India. The indigenous Guzerati and Mahratti word seems to belong rather to what we now call a tank in England; i.e. a small reservoir for a house or ship. Indeed the Port. tanque is no doubt a form of the Lat. stagnum, which gives It. stagno, Fr. old estang and estan, mod. \u00e9tang, Sp. estanque, a word which we have also in old English and in Lowland Scotch, thus:\n 1589. -- \"They had in them stanges or pondes of water full of fish of sundrie sortes.\" -- Parkes's Mendoza, Hak.

In Northern India the general use of the word is as one of ceremonious politeness in speaking of a visit from a superior or from one who is treated in politeness as a superior; when such an one is invited to 'bring his tashr\u012bf,' i.e. 'to carry the honour of his presence,' 'to condescend to visit ' --- . The word always implies superiority on the part of him to whom tashr\u012bf is attributed. It is constantly used by polite natives in addressing Europeans. But when the European in return says (as we have heard said, through ignorance of the real meaning of the phrase), 'I will bring my tashr\u012bf,' the effect is ludicrous in the extreme, though no native will betray his amusement. In S. India the word seems to be used for the dress of honour conferred, and in the old Madras records, rightly or wrongly, for any complimentary present, in fact a honorarium. Thus in Wheeler we find the following:\n 1674. -- \"He (Lingapa, naik of Poonamalee) had, he said, carried a tasheriff to the English, and they had refused to take it. . . .\" -- Op. cit. i. 84.\n 1680. -- \"It being necessary to appoint one as the Company's Chief Merchant (Verona being deceased), resolved Bera Pedda Vincatadry, do succeed and the Tasheriffs be given to him and the rest of the principal Merchants, viz., 3 yards Scarlett to Pedda Vincatadry, and 2\u00bd yards each to four others. . . .\n \"The Governor being informed that Verona's young daughter was melancholly and would not eat because her husband had received no Tasheriff, he also is Tasherifd with 2\u00bd yards Scarlet cloth.\" -- Fort St. Geo.

At the close of the procession the ta'ziyas must be thrown into water; if there be no sufficient mass of water they should be buried. [See Sir L.

Musulm. p. 11.\n", "tea": "s. Crawfurd alleges that we got this word in its various European forms from the Malay Te, the Chinese name being Chha\u0302. The latter is indeed the pronunciation attached, when reading in the 'mandarin dialect,' to the character representing the teaplant, and is the form which has accompanied the knowledge of tea to India, Persia, Portugal, Greece (TSA/I) and Russia. But though it may be probable that Te, like several other names of articles of trade, may have come to us through the Malay, the word is, not the less, originally Chinese, T\u00ea (or Tay as Medhurst writes it) being the utterance attached to the character in the Fuhkien dialect. The original pronunciation, whether direct from Fuh-kien or through the Malay, accompanied the introduction of tea to England as well as other countries of Western Europe. This is shown by several couplets in Pope, e.g.\n 1711.- \". . . There stands a structure of majestic frame Which from the neighbouring Hampton takes its name. * * * * * Here thou, great ANNA, whom three Realms obey, Dost sometimes counsel take, and sometimes tea.\" Rape of the Lock, iii.\n Here tay was evidently the pronunciation, as in Fuh-kien. The Rape of the Lock was published in 1711. In Gray's Trivia, published in 1720, we find tea rhyme to pay, in a passage needless to quote (ii. 296). Fifty years later there seems no room for doubt that the pronunciation had changed to that now in use, as is shown by Johnson's extemporised verses (c. 1770):\n \"I therefore pray thee, Renny, dear, That thou wilt give to me With cream and sugar soften'd well, Another dish of tea\" -- and so on. Johnsoniana, ed. Boswell, 1835, ix. 194.\n The change must have taken place between 1720 and 1750, for about the latter date we find in the verses of Edward Moore:\n \"One day in July last at tea, And in the house of Mrs. P.\" The Trial of Sarah, &c.\n [But the two forms of pronunciation seem to have been in use earlier, as appears from the following advertisement in The Gazette of Sept. 9, 1658 (quoted in 8 ser. N. & Q. vi. 266): \"That excellent, and by all Physitians approved, China Drink, called by the Chineans Toha, by other nations Tay, alias Tee, is sold at the Sultaness Head, a coffee house in Sweetings Rents by the Royal Exchange, London.\"] And in Zedler's Lexicon (1745) it is stated that the English write the word either Tee or Tea, but pronounce it Tiy, which seems to represent our modern pronunciation. [\"Strange to say, the Italians, however, have two names for tea, cia and te, the latter, of course, is from the Chinese word te, noticed above, while the former is derived from the word ch'a. It is curious to note in this connection that an early mention, if not the first notice, of the word in English is under the form cha (in an English Glossary of A.D. 1671); we are also told that it was once spelt tcha -- both evidently derived from the Cantonese form of the word: but 13 years later we have the word derived from the Fokienese te, but borrowed through the French and spelt as in the latter language the; the next change in the word is early in the following century when it drops the French spelling and adopts the present form of tea, though the Fokienese pronunciation, which the French still retain, is not dropped for the modern pronunciation of the now wholly Anglicised word tea till comparatively lately. It will thus be seen that we, like the Italians, might have had two forms of the word, had we not discarded the first, which seemed to have made but little lodgement with us, for the second\" (Ball, Things Chinese, 3rd ed. 583 seq.).]\n Dr. Bretschneider states that the Tea-shrub is mentioned in the ancient Dictionary Rh-ya, which is believed to date long before our era, under the names Kia and K'u-tu (K'u='bitter'), and a commentator on this work who wrote in the 4th century A.D. describes it, adding \"From the leaves can be made by boiling a hot beverage\" (On Chinese Botanical Works, &c., p. 13). But the first distinct mention of teacultivation in Chinese history is said to be a record in the annals of the T'ang Dynasty under A.D. 793, which mentions the imposition in that year of a duty upon tea. And the first western mention of it occurs in the next century, in the notes of the Arab traders, which speak not only of tea, but of this fact of its being subject to a royal impost. Tea does not appear to be mentioned by the medieval Arab writers upon Materia Medica, nor (strange to say) do any of the European travellers to Cathay in the 13th and 14th centuries make mention of it. Nor is there any mention of it in the curious and interesting narrative of the Embassy sent by Sh\u0101h Rukh, the son of the great Timur, to China (1419-21).* The first European work, so far as we are aware, in which tea is named, is Ramusio's (posthumous) Introduction to Marco Polo, in the second volume of his great collection of Navigationi e Viaggi. In this he repeats the account of Cathay which he had heard from Hajji Mahommed, a Persian merchant who visited Venice. Among other matters the Hajji detailed the excellent properties of ChiaiCatai (i.e. Pers. Ch\u0101-i-Khit\u0101\u012b, 'Tea of China'), concluding with an assurance that if these were known in Persia and in Europe, traders would cease to purchase rhubarb, and would purchase this herb instead, a prophecy which has been very substantially verified. We find no mention of tea in the elaborate work of Mendo\u00e7a on China. The earliest notices of which we are aware will be found below. Milburn Mr. Major, in his Introduction to Parke's Mendoza for the Hak. Soc. says of this embassy, that at their halt in the desert 12 marches from Su-chau, they were regaled \"with a variety of strong liquors, together with a pot of Chinese tea.\" It is not stated by Mr. Major whence he took the account; but there is nothing about tea in the translation of M. Quatrem\u00e8re (Not. et Ext. xiv. pt. 1), nor in the Persian text given by him, nor in the translation by Mr. Rehatsek in the Ind. Ant. ii. 75 seqq.\n gives some curious extracts from the E.I. Co.'s records as to the early importation of tea into England. Thus, 1666, June 30, among certain \"raretys,\" chiefly the production of China, provided by the Secretary of the Company for His Majesty, appear:\n \"22\u00be lbs. of thea at 50s. per lb.=\u00a356 17 6 For the two cheefe persons that attended his Majesty, thea. . . . . 6 15 6\"\n In 1667 the E.I. Co.'s first order for the importation of tea was issued to their agent at Bantam: \"to send home by these ships 100lb. weight of the best tey that you can get.\" The first importation actually made for the Co. was in 1669, when two canisters were received from Bantam, weighing 143\u00bd lbs. (Milburn, ii. 531.) [The earliest mention of tea in the Old Records of the India Office is in a letter from Mr. R. Wickham, the Company's Agent at Firando, in Japan, who, writing, June 27, 1615, to Mr. Eaton at Miaco, asks for \"a pt. of the best sort of chaw\" (see Birdwood, Report on Old Records, 26, where the early references are collected).]\n A.D. 851. -- \"The King (of China) reserves to himself . . . a duty on salt, and also on a certain herb which is drunk infused in hot water. This herb is sold in all the towns at high prices; it is called s\u0101kh. It has more leaves than the ratb'ah (Medicago sativa recens) and something more of aroma, but its taste is bitter. Water is boiled and poured upon this herb. The drink so made is serviceable under all circumstances.\"- Relation, &c., trad. par Reinaud, i. 40.\n c. 1545. -- \"Moreover, seeing the great delight that I above the rest of the party took in this discourse of his, he (Chaggi Memet, i.e. Hajji Mahommed) told me that all over the country of Cathay they make use of another plant, that is of its leaves, which is called by those people Chiai Catai: it is produced in that district of Cathay which is called Cachanfu. It is a thing generally used and highly esteemed in all those regions. They take this plant whether dry or fresh, and boil it well in water, and of this decoction they take one or two cups on an empty stomach; it removes fever, headache, stomach-ache, pain in the side or joints; taking care to drink it as hot as you can bear; it is good also for many other ailments which I can't now remember, but I know gout was one of them. And if any one chance to feel his stomach oppressed by overmuch food, if he will take a little of this decoction he will in a short time have digested it. And thus it is so precious and highly esteemed that every one going on a journey takes it with him, and judging from what he said these people would at any time gladly swap a sack of rhubarb for an ounce of Chiai Catai.

I. Kohl, Austria, p. 444.\n The following are some of the names given in the market to different kinds of tea, with their etymologies.\n 1. (TEA), BOHEA. This name is from the Wu-i (dialectically B\u00fa-\u00ee)-shan Mountains in the N.W. of Fuh-kien, one of the districts most famous for its black tea. In Pope's verse, as Crawfurd points out, Bohea stands for a tea in use among fashionable people. Thus:\n \"To part her time 'twixt reading and bohea, To muse, and spill her solitary tea.\" Epistle to Mrs Teresa Blount.\n [The earliest examples in the N.E.D. carry back the use of the word to the first years of the 18th century.]\n 1711. -- \"There is a parcel of extraordinary fine Bohee Tea to be sold at 26s. per Pound, at the sign of the Barber's Pole, next door to the Brazier's Shop in Southampton Street in the Strand.\" -- Advt. in the Spectator of April 2, 1711.\n 1711.- \"Oh had I rather unadmired remained On some lone isle or distant northern land; Where the gilt chariot never marks the way, Where none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea.\" Belinda, in Rape of the Lock, iv. 153.\n The last quotation, and indeed the first also, shows that the word was then pronounced Bohay. At a later date Bohea sank to be the market name of one of the lowest qualities of tea, and we believe it has ceased altogether to be a name quoted in the tea-market. The following quotations seem to show that it was the general name for \"black-tea.\"\n 1711. -- \"Bohea is of little Worth among the Moors and Gentoos of India, Arrabs and Persians . . . that of 45 Tale (see TAEL) would not fetch the Price of green Tea of 10 Tale a Pecull.\" -- Lockyer, 116.\n 1721.- \"Where Indus and the double Ganges flow, On odorif'rous plains the leaves do grow, Chief of the treat, a plant the boast of fame, Sometimes called green, Bohea's the greater name.\" Allan Ramsay's Poems, ed. 1800, i. 213-14.\n 1726. -- \"Anno 1670 and 1680 there was knowledge only of Boey Tea and Green Tea, but later they speak of a variety of other sorts . . . Congo . . . Pego . . . Tongge, Rosmaryn Tea, rare and very dear.\" -- Valentijn, iv. 14.\n 1727. -- \"In September they strip the Bush of all its Leaves, and, for Want of warm dry Winds to cure it, are forced to lay it on warm Plates of Iron or Copper, and keep it stirring gently, till it is dry, and that Sort is called Bohea.\" -- A. Hamilton, ii. 289; [ed. 1744, ii. 288].\n But Zedler's Lexicon (1745) in a long article on Thee gives Thee Bohea as \"the worst sort of all.\" The other European trade-names, according to Zedler, were Thee-Peco, Congo which the Dutch called the best, but Thee Cancho was better still and dearer, and Chaucon best of all.\n 2. (TEA) CAMPOY, a black tea also. Kam-pui, the Canton pron. of the characters Kien-pei, \"select-dry (over a fire).\"\n 3. (TEA) CONGOU (a black tea). This is Kang-hu (t\u00ea) the Amoy pronunciation of the characters Kung-fu, 'work or labour.' [Mr. Pratt (9 ser. N. & Q. iv. 26) writes: \"The N.E.D. under Congou derives it from the standard Chinese Kung-fu (which happens also to be the Cantonese spelling); 'the omission of the f,' we are told, 'is the foreigner's corruption. ' It is nothing of the kind. The Amoy name for this tea is Konghu, so that the omission of the f is due to the local Chinese dialect.\"]\n 4. HYSON (a green tea). This is He(hei and ai in the south) -ch'un, 'bright spring,' [which Mr. Ball (Things Chinese, 586) writes yu-ts'in, 'before the rain'], characters which some say formed the hong name of a tea-merchant named Le, who was in the trade in the dist. of Hiu-ning (S.W. of Hang-chau) about 1700; others say that He-chun was Le's daughter, who was the first to separate the leaves, so as to make what is called Hyson. [Mr. Ball says that it is so called, \"the young hyson being half-opened leaves plucked in April before the spring rains.\"]\n c. 1772.- \"And Venus, goddess of the eternal smile, Knowing that stormy brows but ill become Fair patterns of her beauty, hath ordained Celestial Tea; -- a fountain that can cure The ills of passion, and can free from frowns. * * * * * To her, ye fair! in adoration bow! Whether at blushing morn, or dewy eve, Her smoking cordials greet your fragrant board With Hyson, or Bohea, or Congo crown'd.\" R. Fergusson, Poems.\n 5. OOLONG (bl. tea). Wu-lung, 'black dragon'; respecting which there is a legend to account for the name. [\"A black snake (and snakes are sometimes looked upon as dragons in China) was coiled round a plant of this tea, and hence the name\" (Ball, op. cit. 586).]\n 6. PEKOE (do.). Pak-ho, Canton pron. of characters po\u0306h-hao, 'whitedown.'\n 7. POUCHONG (do.). Pao-chung, 'fold-sort.' So called from its being packed in small paper packets, each of which is supposed to be the produce of one choice tea-plant. Also called Padre-souchong, because the priests in the Wu-i hills and other places prepare and pack it.\n 8. SOUCHONG (do.). Siu-chung, Canton for Siao-chung, 'little-sort.'\n 1781. -- \"Les Nations Europ\u00e9ennes retirent de la Chine des th\u00e9s connus sous les noms de th\u00e9 bouy, th\u00e9 vert, et th\u00e9 saothon.\"- Sonnerat, ii. 249.\n 9. TWANKAY (green tea). From T'un-k'i, the name of a mart about 15 m. S.W. of Hwei-chau-fu in Nganhwei. Bp. Moule says (perhaps after W. Williams?) from T'un-k'i, name of a stream near Yen-shau-fu in Chikiang. [Mr. Pratt (loc. cit.) writes; \"The Amoy Tun-ke is nearer, and the Cantonese Tun-kei nearer still, its second syllable being absolutely the same in sound as the English. The Twankay is a stream in the E. of the province of Nganhwui, where Twankay tea grows.\"] Twankay is used by Theodore Hook as a sort of slang for 'tea.'\n 10. YOUNG HYSON. This is called by the Chinese Y\u00fc-t'sien, 'rainbefore,' or 'Yu-before,' because picked before Kuh-yu, a term falling about 20th April (see HYSON above). According to Giles it was formerly called, in trade, Uchain, which seems to represent the Chinese name. In an \"Account of the Prices at which Teas have been put up to Sale, that arrived in England in 1784, 1785\" (MS. India Office Records) the Teas are (from cheaper to dearer):-\n \"Bohea Tea. Singlo (?), Congou, Hyson.\" Souchong,\n", "tea-caddy": "s. This name, in common English use for a box to contain tea for the daily expenditure of the household, is probably corrupted, as Crawfurd suggests, from catty, a weight of 1\u2153 lb. (q.v.). A 'catty-box,' meaning a box holding a catty, might easily serve this purpose and lead to the name. This view is corroborated by a quotation which we have given under caddy (q.v.) A friend adds the remark that in his youth 'Tea-caddy' was a Londoner's name for Harley Street, due to the number of E.I. Directors and proprietors supposed to inhabit that district.\n", "teapoy": "s. A small tripod table. This word is often in England imagined to have some connection with tea, and hence, in London shops for japanned ware and the like, a teapoy means a tea-chest fixed on legs. But this is quite erroneous. Tip\u0101\u012b is a Hindust\u0101ni, or perhaps rather an Anglo-Hindust\u0101ni word for a tripod, from Hind. t\u012bn, 3, and Pers. p\u0101\u0113, 'foot.' The legitimate word from the Persian is sip\u0101\u012b (properly sihp\u0101ya), and the legitimate Hindi word tirpad or tripad, but tip\u0101\u012b or tepoy was probably originated by some European in analogy with the familiar charpoy (q.v.) or 'four-legs,' possibly from inaccuracy, possibly from the desire to avoid confusion with another very familiar word sepoy, seapoy. [Platts, however, gives tip\u0101\u012b as a regular Hind. word, Skt. tri-p\u0101d-ik\u0101.] The word is applied in India not only to a three-legged table (or any very small table, whatever number of legs it has), but to any tripod, as to the tripod-stands of surveying instruments, or to trestles in carpentry. Sihp\u0101ya occurs in 'Ali of Yezd's history of Timur, as applied to the trestles used by Timur in bridging over the Indus (Elliot, iii. 482). A teapoy is called in Chinese by a name having reference to tea: viz. Ch'achi'rh. It has 4 legs.\n [c. 1809. -- \"(Dinajpoor) Sepaya, a wooden stand for a lamp or candle with three feet.\" -- Buchanan, Eastern India, ii. 945.]\n 1844. -- \"'Well, to be sure, it does seem odd -- very odd;' -- and the old gentleman chuckled, -- 'most odd to find a person who don't know what a tepoy is. . . . Well, then, a tepoy or tinpoy is a thing with three feet, used in India to denote a little table, such as that just at your right.'\n \"'Why, that table has four legs,' cried Peregrine.\n \"'It's a tepoy all the same,' said Mr. Havethelacks.\" -- Peregrine Pulteney, i. 112.\n", "teak": "s. The tree, and timber of the tree, known to botanists as Tectona grandis, L., N. O. Verbenaceae. The word is Malay\u0101l. tekka, Tam. tekku. No doubt this name was adopted owing to the fact that Europeans first became acquainted with the wood in Malabar, which is still one of the two great sources of supply; Pegu being the other. The Skt. name of the tree is \u015b\u0101ka, whence the modern Hind. name s\u0101gw\u0101n or s\u0101g\u016bn and the Mahr. \u015b\u0101g. From this last probably was taken s\u0101j, the name of teak in Arabic and Persian. And we have doubtless the same word in the SAGALI/NA of the Periplus, one of the exports from Western India, a form which may be illustrated by the Mahr. adj. s\u0101gal\u012b, 'made of the teak, belonging to teak.' The last fact shows, in some degree, how old the export of teak is from India. Teak beams, still undecayed, exist in the walls of the great palace of the Sassanid Kings at Seleucia or Ctesiphon, dating from the middle of the 6th century. [See Birdwood, First Letter Book, Intro. XXIX.] Teak has continued to recent times to be imported into Egypt. See Forskal, quoted by Royle (Hindu Medicine, 128). The gopher-wood of Genesis is translated s\u0101j in the Arabic version of the Pentateuch (Royle). [It was probably cedar (see Encycl. Bibl. s.v.)]\n Teak seems to have been hardly known in Gangetic India in former days. We can find no mention of it in Baber (which however is indexless), and the only mention we can find in the \u0100\u012bn, is in a list of the weights of a cubic yard of 72 kinds of wood, where the name \"S\u00e1gaun\" has not been recognised as teak by the learned translator (see Blochmann's E.T. i. p. 228).\n c. A.D. 80. -- \"In the innermost part of this Gulf (the Persian) is the Port of Apologos, lying near Pasine Charax and the river Euphrates.\n \"Sailing past the mouth of the Gulf, after a course of 6 days you reach another port of Persia called Omana.

It was necessary in order to appease them, to give a promise in writing that the body should not be removed from the town, but should have public burial in our church in sight of everybody; and with this assurance it was taken in solemn procession and deposited in a box of teak (teca), which is a wood not subject to decay. . . .\" -- Sousa, Oriente Conquist.

[Others, however, connect it with tara, tala, 'beneath (the Him\u0101laya).'] The term is specially applied to a belt of marshy and jungly land which runs along the foot of the Him\u0101laya north of the Ganges, being that zone in which the moisture which has sunk into the talus of porous material exudes. A tract on the south side of the Ganges, now part of Bh\u0101galp\u016br, was also formerly known as the Jungle-terry (q.v.).\n 1793. -- \"Helloura, though standing very little below the level of Cheeria Ghat's top is nevertheless comprehended in the Turry or Turryani of Nepaul . . .

Hind. th\u0101kur, from Skt. thakkura, 'an idol, a deity.' Used as a term of respect, Lord, Master, &c., but with a variety of specific applications, of which the most familiar is as the style of R\u0101jp\u016bt nobles. It is also in some parts the honorific designation of a barber, after the odd fashion which styles a tailor khal\u012bfa (see CALEEFA); a bihisht\u012b, jama'-d\u0101r (see JEMADAR); a sweeper, mehtar. And in Bengal it is the name of a Brahman family, which its members have Anglicised as Tagore, of whom several have been men of character and note, the best known being Dw\u0101rkan\u0101th Tagore, \"a man of liberal opinions and enterprising character\" (Wilson), who died in London in 1840.\n [c. 1610. -- \"The nobles in blood (in the Maldives) add to their name Tacourou.\"- Pyrard de Laval, Hak.

C. Bose, The Hindoos as they are, 13.]\n", "thermantidote": "s. This learned word (\"heat-antidote\") was applied originally, we believe, about 1830-32 to the invention of the instrument which it designates, or rather to the application of the instrument, which is in fact a winnowing machine fitted to a window aperture, and incased in wet tatties (q.v.), so as to drive a current of cooled air into a house during hot, dry weather. We have a dim remembrance that the invention was ascribed to Dr. Spilsbury.\n 1831. -- \"To the 21st of June, this oppressive weather held its sway; our only consolation grapes, iced-water, and the thermantidote, which answers admirably, almost too well, as on the 22d.

Hind. thag, Mahr. thak, Skt. sthaga, 'a cheat, a swindler.' And this is the only meaning given and illustrated in R. Drummond's Illustrations of Guzerattee, &c. (1808). But it has acquired a specific meaning, which cannot be exhibited more precisely or tersely than by Wilson: This book was printed in England, whilst the author was in India; doubtless he was innocent of this quaint error.\n \"Latterly applied to a robber and assassin of a peculiar class, who sallying forth in a gang . . . and in the character of wayfarers, either on business or pilgrimage, fall in with other travellers on the road, and having gained their confidence, take a favourable opportunity of strangling them by throwing their handkerchiefs round their necks, and then plundering them and burying their bodies.\" The proper specific designation of these criminals was ph\u0101ns\u012bgar or ph\u0101nsigar, from phans\u012b, 'a noose.'\n According to Mackenzie (in As. Res. xiii.) the existence of gangs of these murderers was unknown to Europeans till shortly after the capture of Seringapatam in 1799, when about 100 were apprehended in Bangalore. But Fryer had, a century earlier, described a similar gang caught and executed near Surat. The Ph\u0101nsigars (under that name) figured prominently in an Anglo-Indian novel called, we think, \"The English in India,\" which one of the present writers read in early boyhood, but cannot now trace. It must have been published between 1826 and 1830.\n But the name of Thug first became thoroughly familiar not merely to that part of the British public taking an interest in Indian affairs, but even to the mass of Anglo-Indian society, through the publication of the late Sir William Sleeman's book \"Ramaseeana; or a Vocabulary of the peculiar language used by the Thugs, with an Introduction and Appendix, descriptive of that Fraternity, and of the Measures which have been adopted by the Supreme Government of India for its Suppression,\" Calcutta, 1836; and by an article on it which appeared in the Edinburgh Review, for Jan. 1837, (lxiv. 357). One of Col. Meadows Taylor's Indian romances also, Memoirs of a Thug (1839), has served to make the name and system familiar. The suppression of the system, for there is every reason to believe that it was brought to an end, was organised in a masterly way by Sir W. (then Capt.) Sleeman, a wise and admirable man, under the government and support of Lord William Bentinck. [The question of the Thugs and their modern successors has been again discussed in the Quarterly Review, Oct. 1901.]\n c. 1665. -- \"Les Voleurs de ce pais-l\u00e0 sont les plus adroits du monde; ils ont l'usage d'un certain lasset \u00e0 noeud coulant, qu'ils savent jetter si subtilement au col d'un homme, quand ils sont \u00e0 sa port\u00e9e, qu'ils ne le manquent jamais; en sorte qu'en un moment ils l'\u00e9tranglent . . .\" &c. -- Thevenot, v. 123.\n 1673. -- \"They were Fifteen, all of a Gang, who used to lurk under Hedges in narrow Lanes, and as they found Opportunity, by a Device of a Weight tied to a Cotton Bow-string made of Guts, . . . they used to throw it upon Passengers, so that winding it about their Necks, they pulled them from their Beasts and dragging them upon the Ground strangled them, and possessed themselves of what they had . . . they were sentenced to Lex Talionis, to be hang'd; wherefore being delivered to the Catwal or Sheriff's Men, they led them two Miles with Ropes round their Necks to some Wild Date-trees: In their way thither they were chearful, and went singing, and smoaking Tobacco . . . as jolly as if going to a Wedding; and the Young Lad now ready to be tied up, boasted, That though he were not 14 Years of Age, he had killed his Fifteen Men. . . .\" -- Fryer, 97.\n 1785. -- \"Several men were taken up for a most cruel method of robbery and murder, practised on travellers, by a tribe called phanseegurs, or stranglers . . . under the pretence of travelling the same way, they enter into conversation with the strangers, share their sweetmeats, and pay them other little attentions, until an opportunity offers of suddenly throwing a rope round their necks with a slip-knot, by which they dexterously contrive to strangle them on the spot.\" -- Forbes, Or.

The number of Thugs in the neighbouring countries is enormous; 115, I believe, belonged to the party of which 25 were executed, and the remainder are to be transported; and report says there are as many in Sauger Jail.\"- Wanderings of a Pilgrim, i. 201-202.\n 1843. -- \"It is by the command, and under the special protection of the most powerful goddesses that the Thugs join themselves to the unsuspecting traveller, make friends with him, slip the noose round his neck, plunge their knives in his eyes, hide him in the earth, and divide his money and baggage.\" -- Macaulay, Speech on Gates of Somnauth.\n 1874. -- \"If a Thug makes strangling of travellers a part of his religion, we do not allow him the free exercise of it.\" -- W. Newman, in Fortnightly Rev., N.S. xv. 181.\n [Tavernier writes: \"The remainder of the people, who do not belong to either of these four castes, are called Pauzecour.\" This word Mr. Ball (ii. 185) suggests to be equivalent to either pariah or phansigar. Here he is in error. Pauzecour is really Skt. PanchaGau\u1e0da, the five classes of northern Brahmans, for which see Wilson, (Indian Caste, ii. 124 seqq.).]\n", "tibet": "n.p. The general name of the vast and lofty table-land of which the Him\u0101laya forms the southern marginal range, and which may be said roughly to extend from the Indus elbow, N.W. of Kashm\u012br, to the vicinity of Sining-fu in Kansuh (see SLING) and to Tatsienlu on the borders of Szechuen, the last a distance of 1800 miles. The origin of the name is obscure, but it came to Europe from the Mahommedans of Western Asia; its earliest appearance being in some of the Arab Geographies of the 9th century.\n Names suggestive of Tibet are indeed used by the Chinese. The original form of these (according to our friend Prof. Terrien de la Couperie) was Tu-pot; a name which is traced to a prince so called, whose family reigned at Liang-chau, north of the Yellow R. (in modern Kansuh), but who in the 5th century was driven far to the south-west, and established in eastern Tibet a State to which he gave the name of Tu-pot, afterwards corrupted into Tu-poh and Tu-fan. We are always on ticklish ground in dealing with derivations from or through the Chinese. But it is doubtless possible, perhaps even probable, that these names passed into the western form Tibet, through the communication of the Arabs in Turkestan with the tribes on their eastern border. This may have some corroboration from the prevalence of the name Tibet, or some proximate form, among the Mongols, as we may gather both from Carpini and Rubruck in the 13th century (quoted below), and from Sanang Setzen, and the Mongol version of the Bodhimor several hundred years later. These latter write the name (as represented by I. J. Schmidt), T\u00fcbet and To\u0304bo\u0304t.\n [c. 590. -- \"Tobbat.\" See under INDIA.]\n 851. -- \"On this side of China are the countries of the Taghazghaz and the Kh\u0101k\u0101n of Tibbat; and that is the termination of China on the side of the Turks.\"- Relation, &c., tr. par Reinaud, pt. i. p. 60.\n c. 880. -- \"Quand un \u00e9tranger arrive au Tibet (al-Tibbat), il \u00e9prouve, sans pouvoir s'en rendre compte, un sentiment de gaiet\u00e9 et de bien \u00eatre qui persiste jusqu'au d\u00e9part.\" -- Ibn Khurd\u0101dba, in J.

This (tik\u0101l) is a word which has long been in use by foreign traders to Burma, for the quasistandard weight of (uncoined) current silver, and is still in general use in B. Burma as applied to that value. This weight is by the Burmese themselves called kyat, and is the hundredth part of the viss (q.v.), being thus equivalent to about 1\u00bc rupee in value. The origin of the word tik\u0101l is doubtful. Sir A. Phayre suggests that possibly it is a corruption of the Burmese words ta-kyat, \"one kyat.\" On the other hand perhaps it is more probable that the word may have represented the Indian \u1e6dak\u0101 (see TUCKA). The word is also used by traders to Siam. But there likewise it is a foreign term; the Siamese word being bat. In Siam the tikal is according to Crawfurd a silver coin, as well as a weight equivalent to 225\u00bd grs. English.

The royal tiger was apparently first known to the Greeks by the expedition of Alexander, and a little later by a live one which Seleucus sent to Athens. The animal became, under the Emperors, well known to the Romans, but fell out of the knowledge of Europe in later days, till it again became familiar in India. The Greek and Latin TI/GRIS, tigris, is said to be from the old Persian word for an arrow, tigra, which gives the modern Pers. (and Hind.) t\u012br.* Sir H. Rawlinson gives tigra as old Persian for an arrow (see Herod. vol. iii. p. 552). V\u00fcllers seems to consider it rather an induction than a known word for an arrow. He says: \"Besides the name of that river (Tigris) Arvand, which often occurs in the Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma, and which properly signifies 'running' or 'swift'; another Medo-persic name Tigra is found in the cuneiform inscriptions, and is cognate with the Zend word tedjao, tedjerem, and Pehlvi tedjera, i.e. 'a running river,' which is entered in Anquetil's vocabulary. And these, along with the Persian tej 'an arrow,' tegh 'a sword,' tekh and teg 'sharp,' are to be referred to the Zend root tikhsh, Skt. tij, 'to sharpen.' The Persian word t\u012br, 'an arrow,' may be of the same origin, since its primitive form appears to be t\u012bgra, from which it seems to come by elision of the g. as the Skt. t\u012br, 'arrow,' comes from t\u012bvra for t\u012bgra, where v seems to have taken the place of g. From the word t\u012bgra . . . seem also to be derived the usual names of the river Tigris, Pers, Dizhla, Ar. Dijlah\" (V\u00fcllers, s.v. t\u012br).\n Pliny says of the River Tigris: \"aceleritate Tigris incipit vocari. Ita appellant Medi sagittam\" (vi. 27). In speaking of the animal and its \"velocitatistremendae, \" Pliny evidently glances at this etymology, real or imaginary. So does Pausanias probably, in his remarks on its colour. [This view of the origin of the name is accepted by Schrader (Prehist. Ant. of the Aryan Peoples, E.T. 250), who writes: \"Nothing like so far back in the history of the Indo-Europeans does the lion's dreadful rival for supremacy over the beasts, the tiger, go. In India the songs of the Rigveda have nothing to say about him; his name (vy\u00e1ghr\u00e1) first occurs in the Atharvaveda, i.e. at a time when the Indian immigration must have extended much farther towards the Ganges; for it is in the reeds and grasses of Bengal that we have to look for the tiger's proper home. Nor is he mentioned among the beasts of prey in the Avesta. The district of Hyrcania, whose numerous tigers the later writers of antiquity speak of with especial frequency, was then called Vehrkana, 'wolf-land.' It is, therefore, not improbable . . . that the tiger has spread in relatively late times from India over portions of W. and N. Asia.\"]\n c. B.C. 325. -- \"The Indians think the Tiger (TO\\N TI/GRIN) a great deal stronger than the elephant. Nearchus says he saw the skin of a tiger, but did not see the beast itself, and that the Indians assert the tiger to be as big as the biggest horse; whilst in swiftness and strength there is no creature to be compared to him. And when he engages the elephant he springs on its head, and easily throttles it. Moreover, the creatures which we have seen and call tigers are only jackals which are dappled, and of a kind bigger than ordinary jackals.\" -- Arrian, Indica, xv. We apprehend that this big dappled jackal (QW=S) is meant for a hyaena.\n c. B.C. 322. -- \"In the island of Tylos . . . there is also another wonderful thing they say . . . for there is a certain tree, from which they cut sticks, and these are very handsome articles, having a certain variegated colour, like the skin of a tiger.

The story that he has a triple range of teeth in each jaw, and sharp prickles at the tip of his tail which he shoots at those who are at a distance, like the arrows of an archer, -- I don't believe it to be true, but only to have been generated by the excessive fear which the beast inspires. They have been wrong also about his colour; -- no doubt when they see him in the bright sunlight he takes that colour and looks red; or perhaps it may be because of his going so fast, and because even when not running he is constantly darting from side to side; and then (to be sure) it is always from a long way off that they see him.\" -- Pausanias, IX. xxi. 4.

And indeed the most of these wretched people sleep at the top of the highest trees they can find, for up to a height of 20 palms the tigers can seize them at a leap; and if anything saves the poor people from these beasts it is the bonfires they keep burning at night, which the tigers are much afraid of. In fact these are so numerous that many come into the city itself at night in search of prey.

Nay, some creditable People even have been friendly to the use of it, though from its having been brought sparingly in the first instance from Europe, its rarity prevented it from coming into general use. The Culture of this Plant, however, became speedily almost universal, within a short period after its introduction into Hindostaun; and the produce of it rewarded the Cultivator far beyond every other article of Husbandry. This became more especially the case in the reign of Shah Jehaun (commenced A.H. 1037) when the Practice of Smoking pervaded all Ranks Some notice of Major Yule, whose valuable Oriental MSS. were presented to the British Museum after his death, will be found in Dr. Rieu's Preface to the Catalogue of Persian MSS.

To a stranger no offering was so acceptable as a Whiff, and to a friend one could produce nothing half so grateful as a Chillum. So rooted was the habit that the confirmed Smoker would abstain from Food and Drink rather than relinquish the gratification he derived from inhaling the Fumes of this deleterious Plant! Nature recoils at the very idea of touching the Saliva of another Person, yet in the present instance our Tobacco smokers pass the moistened Tube from one mouth to another without hesitation on the one hand, and it is received with complacency on the other! The more acrid the Fumes so much the more grateful to the Palate of the Connoisseur. The Smoke is a Collyrium to the Eyes, whilst the Fire, they will tell you, supplies to the Body the waste of radical Heat. Without doubt the Hookah is a most pleasing Companion, whether to the Wayworn Traveller or to the solitary Hermit. It is a Friend in whose Bosom we may repose our most confidential Secrets; and a Counsellor upon whose advice we may rely in our most important Concerns. It is an elegant Ornament in our private Appartments: it gives joy to the Beholder in our public Halls. The Music of its sound puts the warbling of the Nightingale to Shame, and the Fragrance of its Perfume brings a Blush on the Cheek of the Rose.

But its modern application is to a Persian money, at the present time worth about 7s. 6d. [In 1899 the exchange was about 53 crans to the \u00a31; 10 Crans = 1 tum\u0101n.] Till recently it was only a money of account, representing 10,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs; the latter also having been in Persia for centuries only a money of account, constantly degenerating in value. The tomaun in Fryer's time (1677) is reckoned by him as equal to \u00a33, 6s. 8d. P. della Valle's estimate 60 years earlier would give about \u00a34, 10s. 0d., and is perhaps loose and too high.

A Chinese alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel, sometimes called 'white copper' (i.e. peh-tung of the Chinese). The finest qualities are alleged to contain arsenic.* The best comes from Yunnan, and Mr. Joubert of the Garnier Expedition, came to the conclusion that it was produced by a direct mixture of the ores in the furnace (Voyage d'Exploration, ii. 160). b. It is used in Indian trade in the same loose way that spelter is used, for either zinc or pewter (peh-yuen, or 'white lead' of the Chinese). The base of the word is no doubt the Pers. t\u016btiya, Skt. tuttha, an oxide of zinc, generally in India applied to blue vitriol or sulphate of copper, but the formation of the word is obscure. Possibly the last syllable is merely an adjective affix, in which way n\u0101k is used in Persian. Or it may be n\u0101ga in the sense of lead, which is one of the senses given by Shakespear. In one of the quotations given below, tutenague is confounded with calin (see CALAY).

A name used in the 17th and 18th centuries for dark-skinned or half-caste claimants of Portuguese descent, and Christian profession. Its application is generally, though not universally, to soldiers of this class, and it is possible that it was originally a corruption of Pers. (from Turkish) top-ch\u012b, 'a gunner.' It may be a slight support to this derivation that Italians were employed to cast guns for the Zamorin at Calicut from a very early date in the 16th century, and are frequently mentioned in the annals of Correa between 1503 and 1510. Various other etymologies have however been given. That given by Orme below (and put forward doubtfully by Wilson) from top\u012b, 'a hat,' has a good deal of plausibility, and even if the former etymology be the true origin, it is probable that this one was often in the minds of those using the term, as its true connotation. It may have some corroboration not only in the fact that Europeans are to this day often spoken of by natives (with a shade of disparagement) as Topeewalas (q.v.) or 'Hat-men,' but also in the pride commonly taken by all persons claiming European blood in wearing a hat; indeed Fra Paolino tells us that this class call themselves gente de chapeo (see also the quotation below from Ovington). Possibly however this was merely a misrendering of topaz from the assumed etymology.

This is Turkish to\u0304p, adopted into Persian and Hindustani. We cannot trace it further. [Mr. Platts regards T. tob, top, as meaning originally 'a round mass,' from Skt. st\u016bpa, for which see below.]\n b. A grove or orchard, and in Upper India especially a mango-orchard. The word is in universal use by the English, but is quite unknown to the natives of Upper India. It is in fact Tam. to\u0304ppu, Tel. to\u0304pu, [which the Madras Gloss. derives from Tam. togu, 'to collect,'] and must have been carried to Bengal by foreigners at an early period of European traffic. But Wilson is curiously mistaken in supposing it to be in common use in Hindustan by natives. The word used by them is b\u0101gh.\n c. An ancient Buddhist monument in the form of a solid dome. The word to\u0304p is in local use in the N.W. Punjab, where ancient monuments of this kind occur, and appears to come from Skt. st\u016bpa through the Pali or Prakrit th\u016bpo. According to Sir H. Elliot (i. 505), Stupa in Icelandic signifies 'a Tower.' We cannot find it in Cleasby.

The Artillery, Artillery Park, or Ordnance Department, Turco-Pers. to\u0304p-kh\u0101na, 'cannon-house' or 'cannon-department.'

This is sometimes referred to Port. topo, 'the top' (also tope, 'a top-knot,' and topete, a 'toupee'), which is probably identical with English and Dutch top, L. German topp, Fr. topet, &c. But there is also a simpler Hind. word \u1e6dop, for a helmet or hat, and the quotation from the Roteiro Vocabulary seems to show that the word existed in India when the Portuguese first arrived.

This name is very generally misapplied by Europeans to the various species of Hornbill, formerly all styled Buceros, but now subdivided into various genera. Jerdon says: \"They (the hornbills) are, indeed, popularly called Toucans throughout India; and this appears to be their name in some of the Malayan isles; the word signifying 'a worker,' from the noise they make.\" This would imply that the term did originally belong to a species of hornbill, and not to the S. American Rhamphastes or Zygodactyle. Tukany is really in Malay a 'craftsman or artificer'; but the dictionaries show no application to the bird. We have here, in fact, a remarkable instance of the coincidences which often justly perplex etymologists, or would perplex them if it were not so much their habit to seize on one solution and despise the others. Not only is tukang in Malay 'an artificer,' but, as Willoughby tells us, the Spaniards called the real S. American toucan 'carpintero' from the noise he makes. And yet there seems no doubt that Toucan is a Brazilian name for a Brazilian bird. See the quotations, and especially Thevet's, with its date.\n The Toucan is described by Oviedo (c. 1535), but he mentions only the name by which \"the Christians\" called it, -- in Ramusio's Italian Picuto (?Beccuto; Sommario, in Ramusio, iii. f. 60). [Prof. Skeat (Concise Dict. s.v.) gives only the Brazilian derivation. The question is still further discussed, without any very definite result, save that it is probably an imitation of the cry of the bird, in N. & Q. 9 ser. vii. 486; viii. 22, 67, 85, 171, 250.]\n 1556. -- \"Sur la coste de la marine, la plus frequ\u1ebdte marchandise est le plumage d'vn oyseau, qu'ils appellent en leur langue Toucan, lequel descrivons sommairement puis qu'il vient \u00e0 propos.

[For a case in Greece, see Pausanias, X. i. 6. Another name for this self-sacrifice is Chandi, which is perhaps Skt. \u0107a\u1e47\u1e0da, 'passionate' (see Malcolm, Cent. India, 2nd ed. ii. 137).

Or. Turk. t\u016bra. This word is used in the Autobiography of Baber, and in other Mahommedan military narratives of the 16th century. It is admitted by the translators of Baber that it is rendered by them quite conjecturally, and we cannot but think that they have missed the truth. The explanation of t\u016br which they quote from Meninski is \"reticulatus,\" and combining this with the manner in which the quotations show these t\u016bra to have been employed, we cannot but think that the meaning which best suits is 'a gabion.' Sir H. Elliot, in referring to the first passage from Baber, adopts the reading t\u016bbra, and says: \"T\u00fabras are nose-bags, but . . . Bad\u00e1\u00fani makes the meaning plain, by saying that they were filled with earth (T\u00e1r\u00edkh-i-Bad\u00e1\u00fani, f. 136). . . . The sacks used by Sher Sh\u00e1h as temporary fortifications on his march towards R\u00e1jp\u00fat\u00e1na were t\u00fabras\" (Elliot, vi. 469). It is evident, however, that Baber's t\u016bras were no tobras, whilst a reference to the passage (Elliot, iv. 405) regarding Sher Sh\u0101h shows that the use of bags filled with sand on that occasion was regarded as a new contrivance. The t\u016bbra of Bad\u00e1\u00fani may therefore probably be a misreading; whilst the use of gabions implies necessarily that they would be filled with earth.\n 1526. -- (At the Battle of P\u0101nipat) \"I directed that, according to the custom of R\u00fbm, the gun-carriages should be connected together with twisted bull-hides as with chains. Between every two guncarriages were 6 or 7 t\u00fbras (or breastworks). The matchlockmen stood behind these guns and t\u00fbras, and discharged their matchlocks. . . . It was settled, that as Pa\u0302nipat was a considerable city, it would cover one of our flanks by its buildings and houses while we might fortify our front by t\u00fbras. . . .\" -- Baber, p. 304.\n 1528. -- (At the siege of Ch\u0101nder\u012b) \"overseers and pioneers were appointed to construct works on which the guns were to be planted. All the men of the army were directed to prepare t\u00fbras and scalingladders, and to serve the t\u00fbras which are used in attacking forts. . . .\" -- Ibid. p. 376. The editor's note at the former passage is: \"The meaning (viz. 'breastwork') assigned to T\u00fbra here, and in several other places is merely conjectural, founded on Petis de la Croix's explanation, and on the meaning given by Meninski to T\u00fbr, viz. reticulatus. The T\u00fbras may have been formed by the branches of trees, interwoven like basketwork . . . or they may have been covered defences from arrows and missiles. . . .\" Again: \"These T\u00fbras, so often mentioned, appear to have been a sort of testudo, under cover of which the assailants advanced, and sometimes breached the wall. . . .\"\n", "turaka": "n.p. This word is applied both in Mahratti and in Telugu to the Mahommedans (Turks). [The usual form in the inscriptions is Turushka (see Bombay Gazetteer, i. pt. i. 189).] Like this is Tar\u016bk (see TAROUK) which the Burmese now apply to the Chinese.\n", "turban": "s. Some have supposed this well-known English word to be a corruption of the P. -- H. sirband, 'head-wrap,' as in the following:\n 1727. -- \"I bought a few seerbunds and sannoes there (at Cuttack) to know the difference of the prices.\" -- A. Hamilton, i. 394 (see PIECE GOODS).\n This, however, is quite inconsistent with the history of the word. Wedgewood's suggestion that the word may be derived from Fr. turbin, 'a whelk,' is equally to be rejected. It is really a corruption of one which, though it seems to be out of use in modern Turkish, was evidently used by the Turks when Europe first became familiar with the Ottomans and their ways. This is set forth in the quotation below from Zedler's Lexicon, which is corroborated by those from Rycaut and from Galland, &c. The proper word was apparently dulband. Some modern Persian dictionaries give the only meaning of this as 'a sash.' But Meninski explains it as 'a cloth of fine white muslin; a wrapper for the head'; and V\u00fcllers also gives it this meaning, as well as that of a 'sash or belt.'* In doing so he quotes The Pers. partala is always used for a 'waistbelt' in India, but in Persia also for a turban.\n Shakespear's Dict., and marks the use as 'Hindustani-Persian.' But a merely Hindustani use of a Persian word could hardly have become habitual in Turkey in the 15th and 16th centuries. The use of dulband for a turban was probably genuine Persian, adopted by the Turks. Its etymology is apparently from Arab. dul, 'volvere,' admitting of application to either a girdle or a head-wrap. From the Turks it passed in the forms Tulipant, Tolliban, Turbant, &c., into European languages. And we believe that the flower tulip also has its name from its resemblance to the old Ottoman turban, [a view accepted by Prof. Skeat (Concise Dict. s.v. tulip, turban)].*\n 1487. -- \". . . tele bambagine assai che loro chiamano turbanti; tele assai colla salda, che lor chiamano sexe (sash). . . .\"- Letter on presents from the Sultan to L. de' Medici, in Roscoe's Lorenzo, ed. 1825, ii. 371-72.\n c. 1490. -- \"Estradiots sont gens comme Genetaires: vestuz, \u00e0 pied et \u00e0 cheval, comme les Turcs, sauf la teste, o\u00f9 ils ne portent ceste toille qu'ils appellent tolliban, et sont durs gens, et couchent dehors tout l'an et leurs chevaulx.\" -- Ph. de Commynes, Liv.

This fowl is called in Hindustani per\u016b, very possibly an indication that it came to India, perhaps first to the Spanish settlements in the Archipelago, across the Pacific, as the red pepper known as Chili did. In Tamil the bird is called v\u0101n-ko\u0304\u1e5bi, 'great fowl.' Our European names of it involve a complication of mistakes and confusions. We name it as if it came from the Levant. But the name turkey would appear to have been originally applied to another of the Pavonidae, the guinea-fowl, Meleagris of the ancients. Minsheu's explanations (quoted below) show strange confusions between the two birds. The French coq d'Inde or Dindon points only ambiguously to India, but the German Calecutische Hahn and the Dutch Kalkoen (from Calicut) are specific in error as indicating the origin of the Turkey in the East. This misnomer may have arisen from the nearly simultaneous discovery of America and of the Cape route to Calicut, by Spain and Portugal respectively. It may also have been connected with the fact that Malabar produced domestic fowls of extraordinary size. Of these Ibn Batuta (quoted below) makes quaint mention. Zedler's great German Lexicon of Universal Knowledge, a work published as late as 1745, says that these birds (turkeys) were called Calecutische and Indische because they were brought by the Portuguese from the Malabar coast. Dr. Caldwell cites a curious disproof of the antiquity of certain Tamil verses from their containing a simile of which the turkey forms the subject. And native scholars, instead of admitting the anachronism, have boldly maintained that the turkey had always been found in India (Dravidian Gramm. 2nd ed. p. 137). Padre Paolino was apparently of the same opinion, for whilst explaining that the etymology of Calicut is \"Castle of the Fowls,\" he asserts that Turkeys (Galli d'India) came originally from India; being herein, as he often is, positive and wrong. In 1615 we find W. Edwards, the E.I. Co.'s agent at Ajmir, writing to send the Mogul \"three or four Turkey cocks and hens, for he hath three cocks but no hens' (Colonial Paper, E. i. c. 388). Here, however, the ambiguity between the real turkey and the guinea-fowl may possibly arise. In Egypt the bird is called Dik-R\u016bm\u012b, 'fowl of R\u016bm' (i.e. of Turkey), probably a rendering of the English term.\n c. 1347. -- \"The first time in my life that I saw a China cock was in the city of Kaulam.

The term is supposed to be adopted from Skt. tasara, trasara, Hind. tasar, 'a shuttle'; perhaps from the form of the cocoon? The moth whose worm produced this silk is generally identified with Antheraea paphia, but Capt. Hutton has shown that there are several species known as tasar worms. These are found almost throughout the whole extent of the forest tracts of India.

A tornado or cyclone-wind; a sudden storm, a 'norwester ' (q.v.). Sir John Barrow (see Autobiog. 57) ridicules \"learned antiquarians\" for fancying that the Chinese took typhoon from the Egyptian Typhon, the word being, according to him, simply the Chinese syllables, ta-fung, 'Great Wind.' His ridicule is misplaced. With a monosyllabic language like the Chinese (as we have remarked elsewhere) you may construct a plausible etymology, to meet the requirements of the sound alone, from anything and for anything. And as there is no evidence that the word is in Chinese use at all, it would perhaps be as fair a suggestion to derive it from the English \"tough 'un.\" Mr. Giles, who seems to think that the balance of evidence is in favour of this (Barrow's) etymology, admits a serious objection to be that the Chinese have special names for the typhoon, and rarely, if ever, speak of it vaguely as a 'great wind.' The fact is that very few words of the class used by seafaring and trading people, even when they refer to Chinese objects, are directly taken from the Chinese language. E.g. Mandarin, pagoda, chop, cooly, tutenague;- none of these are Chinese. And the probability is that Vasco and his followers got the tufa\u0303o, which our sailors made into touffon and then into typhoon, as they got the mon\u00e7a\u0303o which our sailors made into monsoon, direct from the Arab pilots.\n The Arabic word is \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n, which is used habitually in India for a sudden and violent storm. Lane defines it as meaning 'an overpowering rain, . . . Noah's flood,' etc. And there can be little doubt of its identity with the Greek TUFW=N or TUFW/N. [But Burton (Ar. Nights, iii. 257) alleges that it is pure Arabic, and comes from the root \u1e6dauf, 'going round.'] This word TUFW/N (the etymologists say, from TUFW/, 'I raise smoke') was applied to a demongiant or Titan, and either directly from the etym. meaning or from the name of the Titan (as in India a whirlwind is called 'a Devil or Pisachee') to a 'waterspout,' and thence to analogous stormy phenomena. 'Waterspout' seems evidently the meaning of TUFW/N in the Meteorologica of Aristotle (GI/GNETAI ME\\N OU)=N TUFW/N . . . K.T.L.) iii. 1; the passage is exceedingly difficult to render clearly); and also in the quotation which we give from Aulus Gellius. The word may have come to the Arabs either in maritime intercourse, or through the translations of Aristotle. It occurs (al-\u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n) several times in the Koran; thus in sura, vii. 134, for a flood or storm, one of the plagues of Egypt, and in s. xxix. 14 for the Deluge.\n Dr. F. Hirth, again (Journ. R. Geog. Soc. i. 260), advocates the quasi-Chinese origin of the word. Dr. Hirth has found the word T'ai (and also with the addition of fung, 'wind') to be really applied to a certain class of cyclonic winds, in a Chinese work on Formosa, which is a re-issue of a book originally published in 1694. Dr. Hirth thinks t'ai as here used (which is not the Chinese word ta or tai, 'great,' and is expressed by a different character) to be a local Formosan term; and is of opinion that the combination t'ai-fung is \"a sound so near that of typhoon as almost to exclude all other conjectures, if we consider that the writers using the term in European languages were travellers distinctly applying it to storms encountered in that part of the China Sea.\" Dr. Hirth also refers to F. Mendes Pinto and the passages (quoted below) in which he says tufa\u0303o is the Chinese name for such storms. Dr. Hirth's paper is certainly worthy of much more attention than the scornful assertion of Sir John Barrow, but it does not induce us to change our view as to the origin of typhoon.\n Observe that the Port. tufa\u0303o distinctly represents \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n and not t'aifung, and the oldest English form 'tuffon' does the same, whilst it is not by any means unquestionable that these Portuguese and English forms were first applied in the China Sea, and not in the Indian Ocean. Observe also Lord Bacon's use of the word typhones in his Latin below; also that \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n is an Arabic word, at least as old as the Koran, and closely allied in sound and meaning to TUFW/N, whilst it is habitually used for a storm in Hindustani. This is shown by the quotations below (1810-1836); and Platts defines \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n as \"a violent storm of wind and rain, a tempest, a typhoon; a flood, deluge, inundation, the universal deluge\" etc.; also \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n\u012b, \"stormy, tempestuous . . . boisterous, quarrelsome, violent, noisy, riotous.\"\n Little importance is to be attached to Pinto's linguistic remarks such as that quoted, or even to the like dropt by Couto. We apprehend that Pinto made exactly the same mistake that Sir John Barrow did; and we need not wonder at it, when so many of our countrymen in India have supposed hackery to be a Hindustani word, and when we find even the learned H. H. Wilson assuming tope (in the sense of 'grove') to be in native Hindustani use. Many instances of such mistakes might be quoted. It is just possible, though not we think very probable, that some contact with the Formosan term may have influenced the modification of the old English form tuffon into typhoon. It is much more likely to have been influenced by the analogies of monsoon, simoom; and it is quite possible that the Formosan mariners took up their (unexplained) t'ai-fung from the Dutch or Portuguese.\n On the origin of the Ar. word the late Prof. Robertson-Smith forwarded the following note:\n \"The question of the origin of \u1e6c\u016bf\u0101n appears to be somewhat tangled.\n \"*TUFW=N, 'whirlwind, waterspout,' connected with TU=FOS seems pure Greek; the combination in Baal-Zephon, Exod. xiv. 2, and Seph\u00f3ni, the northern one, in Joel, ii. 20, suggested by Hitzig, appears to break down, for there is no proof of any Egyptian name for Set corresponding to Typhon.\n \"On the other hand \u1e6c\u016bf\u0101n, the deluge, is plainly borrowed from the Aramaic. T\u016bf\u0101n, for Noah's flood, is both Jewish, Aramaic and Syriac, and this form is not borrowed from the Greek, but comes from a true Semitic root \u1e6d\u016bf 'to overflow.'\n \"But again, the sense of whirlwind is not recognised in classical Arabic. Even Dozy in his dictionary of later Arabic only cites a modern French-Arabic dictionary (Bocthor's) for the sense, Tourbillon, trombe. Bist\u00e1n\u00ed in the Mo\u1e25\u00edt el Mo\u1e25\u00edt does not give this sense, though he is pretty full in giving modern as well as old words and senses. In Arabic the root \u1e6d\u016bf means 'to go round,' and a combination of this idea with the sense of sudden disaster might conceivably have given the new meaning to the word. On the other hand it seems simpler to regard this sense as a late loan from some modern form of TUFW/N, typho, or tifone. But in order finally to settle the matter one wants examples of this sense of \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n.\"\n [Prof. Skeat (Concise Dict. s.v.) gives: \"Sometimes claimed as a Chinese word meaning 'a great wind' . . . but this seems to be a late mystification. In old authors the forms are tuffon, tuffoon, tiphon, &c. -- Arab. \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n, a hurricane, storm. Gk. TUFW/N, better TUFW/S, a whirlwind.

Eight days before, the clouds also are seen to float so low as almost to graze men's heads, whilst in these days the seas seem beaten down as it were, and of a deep blue colour. And before the storm breaks forth, the sky exhibits a token well-known to all, a great object which seamen call the Ox-Eye (Olho de Boi) all of different colours, but so gloomy and appalling that it strikes fear in all who see it. And as the Bow of Heaven, when it appears, is the token of fair weather, and calm, so this seems to portend the Wrath of God, as we may well call such a storm. . . .\" &c. -- Couto, V. viii. 12.\n 1610. -- \"But at the breaking vp, commeth alway a cruell Storme, which they call the Tuffon, fearfull even to men on land; which is not alike extreame euery yeare.\" -- Finch, in Purchas, i. 423.\n 1613. -- \"E porque a terra he salitrosa e ventosa, he muy sogeita a tempestades, ora menoraquella chamada Ecnephia (EKNEFIAS), ora maior chamada Tiphon (TNFWN), aquelle de ordinario chamamos Tupha\u0303o ou Tormenta desfeita . . . e corre com tanta furia e impeto que desfas os tectos das casas e aranca arvores, e as vezes do mar lan\u00e7a as embarca\u00e7\u00f5es em terra nos campos do serta\u0303o.\" -- Godinho de Eredia, f. 36v.\n 1615. -- \"And about midnight Capt.
