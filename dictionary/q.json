{"quedda": "n.p. A city, port, and small kingdom on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, tributary to Siam. The name according to Crawfurd is Malay kad\u00e1h, 'an elephanttrap' (see KEDDAH). [Mr. Skeat writes: \"I do not know what Crawfurd's authority may be, but kedah does not appear in Klinkert's Dict. . . . In any case the form taken by the name of the country is Ke\u0306dah. The coralling of elephants is probably a Siamese custom, the method adopted on the E. coast, where the Malays are left to themselves, being to place a decoy female elephant near a powerful noose.\"] It has been supposed sometimes that Kad\u00e1h is the *KW=LI or *KW=LIS of Ptolemy's sea-route to China, and likewise the Kalah of the early Arab voyagers, as in the Fourth Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman (see Procgs. R. Geog. Soc. 1882, p. 655; Burton, Arabian Nights, iv. 386). It is possible that these old names however represent Kwala, 'a river mouth,' a denomination of many small ports in Malay regions. Thus the port that we call Quedda is called by the Malays Kwala Batrang.\n 1516. -- \"Having left this town of Tanassary, further along the coast towards Malaca, there is another seaport of the Kingdom of Ansiam, which is called Queda, in which also there is much shipping, and great interchange of merchandise.\" -- Barbosa, 188-189.\n 1553. -- \". . .

It is mentioned in the Roteiro, and in Barros's account of Da Gama's voyage. Barros had access to a native chronicle of Quiloa, and says it was founded about A.H. 400, and a little more than 70 years after Magadoxo and Brava, by a Persian Prince from Shiraz.\n 1220. -- \"Kilwa, a place in the country of Zenj, a city.\" -- Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt, (orig.), iv. 302.\n c. 1330. -- \"I embarked at the town of Makdashau (Magadoxo), making for the country of the Saw\u0101\u1e25il, and the town of Kulw\u0101, in the country of the Zenj. . . .\"- Ibn Batuta, ii. 191.

A form which we have adopted from the Portuguese for the name of a town now belonging to Travancore; once a very famous and much frequented port of Malabar, and known to the Arabs as Kaulam. The proper name is Tamil, Kollam, of doubtful sense in this use. Bishop Caldwell thinks it may be best explained as 'Palace' or 'royal residence, ' from Kolu, 'the royal Presence,' or Hall of Audience. [Mr. Logan says: \"Kollam is only an abbreviated form of Koyilagam or Kovilagam, 'King's house'\" (Malabar, i. 231, note).] For ages Kaulam was known as one of the greatest ports of Indian trade with Western Asia, especially trade in pepper and brazil-wood. It was possibly the Mal\u00e9 of Cosmas in the 6th century (see MALABAR), but the first mention of it by the present name is about three centuries later, in the Relation translated by Reinaud. The 'Kollam era' in general use in Malabar dates from A.D. 824; but it does not follow that the city had no earlier existence. In a Syriac extract (which is, however, modern) in Land's Anecdota Syriaca (Latin, i. 125; Syriac, p. 27) it is stated that three Syrian missionaries came to Kaulam in A.D. 823, and got leave from King Shak\u012brb\u012brt\u012b to build a church and city at Kaulam. It would seem that there is some connection between the date assigned to this event, and the 'Kollam era'; but what it is we cannot say. Shak\u012brb\u012brt\u012b is evidently a form of Chakravartti R\u0101ja (see under CHUCKERBUTTY). Quilon, as we now call it, is now the 3rd town of Travancore, pop. (in 1891) 23,380; there is little trade. It had a European garrison up to 1830, but now only one Sepoy regiment.\n In ecclesiastical narratives of the Middle Ages the name occurs in the form Columbum, and by this name it was constituted a See of the Roman Church in 1328, suffragan of the Archbishop of Sultaniya in Persia; but it is doubtful if it ever had more than one bishop, viz. Jordanus of Severac, author of the Mirabilia often quoted in this volume. Indeed we have no knowledge that he ever took up his bishopric, as his book was written, and his nomination occurred, both during a visit to Europe. The Latin Church however which he had founded, or obtained the use of, existed 20 years later, as we know from John de' Marignolli, so it is probable that he had reached his See. The form Columbum is accounted for by an inscription (see Ind. Antiq. ii. 360) which shows that the city was called Kolamba, [other forms being Kelambapa\u1e6d\u1e6dana, or K\u0101lambapa\u1e6d\u1e6dana (Bombay Gazetteer, vol. i. pt. i. 183)]. The form Palumbum also occurs in most of the MSS. of Friar Odoric's Journey; this is the more difficult to account for, unless it was a mere play (or a trick of memory) on the kindred meanings of columba and palumbes. A passage in a letter from the Nestorian Patriarch Yeshu'yab (c. 650-60) quoted in Assemani (iii. pl. i. 131), appears at that date to mention Colon. But this is an arbitrary and erroneous rendering in Assemani's Latin. The Syriac has Kalah, and probably therefore refers to the port of the Malay regions noticed under CALAY and QUEDDA.\n 851. -- \"De ce lieu (Mascate) les navires mettent la voile pour l'Inde, et se dirigent vers Koulam-Malay; la distance entre Mascate et Koulam-Malay est d'un mois de marche, avec un vent mod\u00e9r\u00e9.\" -- Relation, &c., tr. by Reinaud, i. 15.\n 1166. -- \"Seven days from thence is Chulam, on the confines of the country of the sun-worshippers, who are descendants of Kush . . . and are all black.
