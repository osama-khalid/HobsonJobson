Ujjayan\u012b, or, in the modern vernacular, Ujjain, one of the most ancient of Indian cities, and one of their seven sacred cities. It was the capital of King Vikramaditya, and was the first meridian of Hindu astronomers, from which they calculated their longitudes.\n The name of Ujjain long led to a curious imbroglio in the interpretation of the Arabian geographers. Its meridian, as we have just mentioned, was the zero of longitude among the Hindus. The Arab writers borrowing from the Hindus wrote the name apparently Az\u012bn, but this by the mere omission of a diacritical point became Ar\u012bn, and from the Arabs passed to medieval Christian geographers as the name of an imaginary point on the equator, the intersection of the central meridian with that circle. Further, this point, or transposed city, had probably been represented on maps, as we often see cities on medieval maps, by a cupola or the like. And hence the \"Cupola of Arin or Arym,\" or the \"Cupola of the Earth\" (Al-\u1e33ubba alar\u1e0dh) became an established commonplace for centuries in geographical tables or statements. The idea was that just 180\u02da of the earth's circumference was habitable, or at any rate cognizable as such, and this meridian of Arin bisected this habitable hemisphere. But as the western limit extended to the Fortunate Isles, it became manifest to the Arabs that the central meridian could not be so far east as the Hindu meridian of Arin (or of Lanka, i.e. Ceylon). (See quotation from the Aryabhatta, under JAVA.) They therefore shifted it westward, but shifted the mystic Arin along the equator westward also. We find also among medieval European students (as with Roger Bacon, below), a confusion between Arin and Syene. This Reinaud supposes to have arisen from the *)ESSINA\\ E)MPO/RION of Ptolemy, a place which he locates on the Zanzibar coast, and approximating to the shifted position of Arin. But it is perhaps more likely that the confusion arose from some survival of the real name Az\u012bn. Many conjectures were vainly made as to the origin of Arym, and M. Sedillot was very positive that nothing more could be learned of it than he had been able to learn. But the late M. Reinaud completely solved the mystery by pointing out that Arin was simply a corruption of Ujjain. Even in Arabic the mistake had been thoroughly ingrained, insomuch that the word Ar\u012bn had been adopted as a generic name for a place of medium temperature or qualities (see Jorj\u0101n\u012b, quoted below).\n c.

A good example of plausible but entirely incorrect etymology is that of orange from Lat. aurantium. The latter word is in fact an ingenious medieval fabrication. The word doubtless came from the Arab. n\u0101ranj, which is again a form of Pers. n\u0101rang, or n\u0101rang\u012b, the latter being still a common term for the orange in Hindustan. The Persian indeed may be traced to Skt. n\u0101gara\u00f1ga, and n\u0101ra\u00f1ga, but of these words no satisfactory etymological explanation has been given, and they have perhaps been Sanscritized from some southern term. Sir W. Jones, in his article on the Spikenard of the Ancients, quotes from Dr. Anderson of Madras, \"a very curious philogical remark, that in the Tamul dictionary, most words beginning with nar have some relation to fragrance; as narukeradu, to yield an odour; n\u00e1rtum pillei, lemon-grass; n\u00e1rtei, citron; n\u00e1rta manum (read m\u0101rum), the wild orange-tree; n\u00e1rum panei, the Indian jasmine; n\u00e1rum alleri, a strong smelling flower; and n\u00e1rtu, which is put for nard in the Tamul version of our scriptures.\" (See As. Res. vol. ii. 414). We have not been able to verify many of these Tamil terms. But it is true that in both Tamil and Malayalam na\u1e5bu is 'fragrant.' See, also, on the subject of this article, A. E. Pott, in Lassen's Zeitschrift f. d. Kunde des Morgenlandes, vii. 114 seqq.\n The native country of the orange is believed to be somewhere on the northern border of India. A wild orange, the supposed parent of the cultivated species, both sweet and bitter, occurs in Garhw\u0101l and Sikkim, as well as in the K\u0101\u1e63ia (see COSSYA) country, the valleys of which last are still abundantly productive of excellent oranges. [See Watt, Econ. Dict. ii. 336 seqq.] It is believed that the orange first known and cultivated in Europe was the bitter or Seville orange (see Hanbury and Fl\u00fcckiger, 111-112).\n From the Arabic, Byzantine Greek got NERA/NTZION, the Spaniards naranja, old Italian narancia, the Portuguese laranja, from which last, or some similar form, by the easy detachment of the l (taken probably, as in many other instances, for an article), we have the Ital. arancio, L. Latin aurantium, French orange, the modification of these two being shaped by aurum and or. Indeed, the quotation from Jacques de Vitry possibly indicates that some form like al-arangi may have been current in Syria. Perhaps, however, his phrase ab indigenis nuncupantur may refer only to the Frank or quasiFrank settlers, in which case we should have among them the birthplace of our word in its present form. The reference to this passage we derived in the first place from Hehn, who gives a most interesting history of the introduction of the various species of citrus into Europe. But we can hardly think he is right in supposing that the Portuguese first brought the sweet orange (Citrus aurantium dulce) into Europe from China, c. 1548. No doubt there may have been a reintroduction of some fine varieties at that time.* But as early as the beginning of the 14th century we find Abulfeda extolling the fruit of Cintra. His words, as rendered by M. Reinaud, run: \"Au nombre des dependances de Lisbonne est la ville de Schintara; \u00e0 Schintara on recueille des pommes admirables pour la grosseur et le gout\" (244\u2020). That these pommes were the famous Cintra oranges can hardly be There seems to have been great oscillation of traffic in this matter. About 1873, one of the present writers, then resident at Palermo, sent, in compliance with a request from Lahore, a collection of plants of many (about forty) varieties of citrus cultivated in Sicily, for introduction into the Punjab. This despatch was much aided by the kindness of Prof. Todaro, in charge of the Royal Botanic Garden at Palermo.\n In Reiske's version \"poma stupendae moliset excellentissima.\" -- B\u00fcsching's Magazin, iv. 230.\n doubted. For Baber (Autobiog. 328) describes an orange under the name of Sangtarah, which is, indeed, a recognised Persian and Hind. word for a species of the fruit. And this early propagation of the sweet orange in Portugal would account not only for such wide diffusion of the name of Cintra, but for the persistence with which the alternative name of Portugals has adhered to the fruit in question. The familiar name of the large sweet orange in Sicily and Italy is portogallo, and nothing else; in Greece PORTOGALE/A, in Albanian protokale, among the Kurds portogh\u0101l; whilst even colloquial Arabic has burtu\u1e33\u0101n. The testimony of Ma\u1e63'\u016bd\u012b as to the introduction of the orange into Syria before his time (c. A.D. 930), even if that were (as it would seem) the Seville orange, renders it quite possible that better qualities should have reached Lisbon or been developed there during the Saracenic occupation. It was indeed suggested in our hearing by the late Sir Henry M. Elliot that sangtarah might be interpreted as sang-tar, 'green stones' (or in fact 'moist pips'); but we hardly think he would have started this had the passage in Abulfeda been brought to his notice. [In the \u0100\u012bn (ed. Gladwin, 1800, ii. 20) we read: \"Sircar Silhet. . . . Here grows a delicious fruit called Soontara, in colour like an orange, but of an oblong form.\" This passage reads in Col. Jarrett's translation (ii. 124): \"There is a fruit called S\u00fantarah in colour like an orange but large and very sweet.\" Col. Jarrett disputes the derivation of Sangtarah from Cintra, and he is followed by Mr. H. Beveridge, who remarks that Humayun calls the fruit Sanatra. Mr. Beveridge is inclined to think that Santra is the Indian hill name of the fruit, of which Sangtarah is a corruption, and refers to a village at the foot of the Bhutan Hills called Santrab\u0101r\u012b, because it had orange groves.]\n A.D. c. 930. -- \"The same may be said of the orange-tree (Shajr-ul-n\u0101ranj) and of the round citron, which were brought from India after the year (A.H.) 300, and first sown in 'Oman.

It is Malay, o\u0304r\u0103ng-\u016bt\u0103n, 'homo sylvaticus.' The proper name of the animal in Borneo is mias. Crawfurd says that it is never called orang-utan by 'the natives.' But that excellent writer is often too positive -- especially in his negatives! Even if it be not (as is probable) anywhere a recognised specific name, it is hardly possible that the name should not be sometimes applied popularly. We remember a tame hooluck belonging to a gentleman in E. Bengal, which was habitually known to the natives as jangl\u012b \u0101dm\u012b, literally=orang-utan. [There seems reason to believe that Crawfurd was right after all. Mr. Scott (Malayan Words in English, p. 87) writes: \"But this particular application of o\u0304rang \u016btan to the ape does not appear to be, or ever to have been, familiar to the Malays generally; Crawfurd (1852) and Swettenham (1889) omit it, Pijnappel says it is 'Low Malay,' and Klinkert (1893) denies the use entirely. This uncertainty is explained by the limited area in which the animal exists within even native observation. Mr. Wallace could find no natives in Sumatra who 'had ever heard of such an animal,' and no 'Dutch officials who knew anything about it.' Then the name came to European knowledge more than 260 years ago; in which time probably more than one Malay name has faded out of general use or wholly disappeared, and many other things have happened.\" Mr. Skeat writes: \"I believe Crawfurd is absolutely right in saying that it is never called o\u0304rang\u016btan by the natives. It is much more likely to have been a sailor's mistake or joke than an error on the part of the Malays who know better. Throughout the Peninsula o\u0304rang-\u016btan is the name applied to the wild tribes, and though the mawas or mias is known to the Malays only by tradition, yet in tradition the two are never confused, and in those islands where the mawas does exist he is never called o\u0304rang-\u016btan, the word o\u0304rang being reserved exclusively to describe the human species.\"]\n 1631. -- \"Loqui vero eos easque posse Iavani aiunt, sed non velle, ne ad labores cogantur; ridicule mehercules.
